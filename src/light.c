/*
 * Mobile light sources.
 *
 * This implementation minimizes memory at the expense of extra
 * recalculations.
 *
 * Light sources are "things" that have a physical position and range.
 * They have a type, which gives us information about them.  Currently
 * they are only attached to objects and monsters.  Note well:  the
 * polymorphed-player handling assumes that both g.youmonst.m_id and
 * g.youmonst.mx will always remain 0.
 *
 * Light sources, like timers, either follow game play (RANGE_GLOBAL) or
 * stay on a level (RANGE_LEVEL).  Light sources are unique by their
 * (type, id) pair.  For light sources attached to objects, this id
 * is a pointer to the object.
 *
 * The major working function is do_light_sources(). It is called
 * when the vision system is recreating its "could see" array.  Here
 * we add a flag (TEMP_LIT) to the array for all locations that are lit
 * via a light source.  The bad part of this is that we have to
 * re-calculate the LOS of each light source every time the vision
 * system runs.  Even if the light sources and any topology (vision blocking
 * positions) have not changed.  The good part is that no extra memory
 * is used, plus we don't have to figure out how far the sources have moved,
 * or if the topology has changed.
 *
 * The structure of the save/restore mechanism is amazingly similar to
 * the timer save/restore.  This is because they both have the same
 * principals of having pointers into objects that must be recalculated
 * across saves and restores.
