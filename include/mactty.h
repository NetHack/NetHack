 * This header is the supported external interface for the "tty" window
 * package. This package sports care-free handling of "dumb" tty windows
 * (preferably using monospaced fonts) - it does NOT remember the strings
 * sent to it; rather, it uses an offscreen bitmap.
 *
 * For best performance, make sure it is aligned on a 32-pixel boundary
 * (or at least a 16-pixel one) in black & white. For 24bit color,
 * alignment doesn't matter, and for 8-bit color, alignment to every
 * fourth pixel is most efficient.

/*
 * You should really not poke in the structures used by the tty window.
 * However, since it uses the wRefCon of windows (by calling GetWRefCon
 * and SetWRefCon) you lose that possibility. If you still want to store
 * information about a window, the FIRST location _pointed to_ by the
 * wRefCon will be a void * that you can use for whatever reasons. Don't
 * take the address of this variable and expect it to stay the same
 * across calls to the tty window.

/*
 * The library uses the window's port temporarily through SetPortBits;
 * that means you shouldn't do any funky things to the clipping region
 * etc. Actually, you shouldn't even resize the window, as that will clip
 * new drawing.
 *
 * Also, if you use this library under Pascal, remember that the string
 * passed to add_tty_string() is a "C" style string with NO length byte,
 * and a terminating zero byte at the end instead.
