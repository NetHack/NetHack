 *            If SYSCF is defined, the following configuration info is
 *            available in a global config space, with the compiled-in

 *                           this does NOT default to compiled-in value)
 *              EXPLORERS    (who can use explore mode, aka discover mode)
 *              SHELLERS     (who can use ! to execute a shell subprocess)
 *              MAXPLAYERS   (see MAX_NR_OF_PLAYERS below and nethack.sh)

 *            For the record file (see topten.c):
 *              PERSMAX      (max entries for one person)
 *              ENTRYMAX     (max entries in the record file)
 *              POINTSMIN    (min points to get an entry)
 *              PERS_IS_UID  (0 or 1 - person is name or (numeric) userid)
 *            Can force incubi/succubi behavior to be toned down to nymph-like:
 *              SEDUCE       (0 or 1 - runtime disable/enable SEDUCE option)
 *            The following options pertain to crash reporting:
 *              GREPPATH     (the path to the system grep(1) utility)
 *              GDBPATH      (the path to the system gdb(1) program)
 *            Regular nethack options can also be specified in order to
 *            provide system-wide default values local to your system:
 *              OPTIONS      (same as in users' .nethackrc or defaults.nh)
 *
 *              In the future there may be other ways to supply SYSCF
 *              information (Windows registry, Apple resource forks, etc)
 *              but at present the only supported method is via a text file.
 *              If the program is built with SYSCF enabled, the file *must*
 *              exist and be readable, otherwise the game will complain and
 *              refuse to start.

 *
 *      Defining RLECOMP builds in support for internal run-length

 *      it can be toggled on/off at runtime via the config file option
 *      rlecomp.
 *
 *      Defining ZEROCOMP builds in support for internal zero-comp
 *      compression of data. If ZEROCOMP support is included it can still
 *      be toggled on/off at runtime via the config file option zerocomp.
 *
 *      RLECOMP and ZEROCOMP support can be included even if
 *      COMPRESS or ZLIB_COMP support is included. One reason for doing
 *      so would be to provide savefile read compatibility with a savefile
 *      where those options were in effect. With RLECOMP and/or ZEROCOMP
 *      defined, NetHack can read an rlecomp or zerocomp savefile in, yet
