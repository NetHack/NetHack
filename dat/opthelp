Boolean options not under specific compile flags (with default values in []):

Boolean option if INSURANCE was set at compile time:
checkpoint save game state after each level change, for possible  [TRUE]
           recovery after program crash

Boolean option if NEWS was set at compile time:
news       print any news from game administrator on startup      [TRUE]

Boolean option if MFLOPPY was set at compile time:
checkspace check free disk space before writing files to disk     [TRUE]

Boolean option if EXP_ON_BOTL was set at compile time:
showexp    display your accumulated experience points             [FALSE]

Boolean option if SCORE_ON_BOTL was set at compile time:
showscore  display your approximate accumulated score             [FALSE]

Boolean options if TEXTCOLOR was set at compile time:
color      use different colors for objects on screen   [TRUE for micros]
hilite_pet display pets in a highlighted manner                   [FALSE]

Boolean option if TIMED_DELAY was set at compile time (tty interface only):
timed_delay    on unix and VMS, use a timer instead of sending
               extra screen output when attempting to pause for
               display effect.  on MSDOS without the termcap
               lib, whether or not to pause for visual effect.    [TRUE]

Boolean option if TTY_GRAPHICS was set at compile time:

Boolean option if USE_TILES was set at compile time (MSDOS protected mode only):
preload_tiles  control whether tiles get pre-loaded into RAM at the
               start of the game.  Doing so enhances performance
               of the tile graphics, but uses more memory.        [TRUE]

Any Boolean option can be negated by prefixing it with a '!' or 'no'.


Compound options are written as option_name:option_value.

Compound options which can be set during the game are:

boulder       override the default boulder symbol with another default:`
disclose      the types of information you want offered at the end of the
              game  [all]
fruit         the name of a fruit you enjoy eating  [slime mold]
              (basically a whimsy which NetHack uses from time to time).
menustyle     user interface for selection of multiple objects:
              Traditional -- one object at a time prompting;
              Combination -- prompt for classes of interest, then menu;
              Partial     -- skip class prompt, use menu of all objects;
              Full        -- menu for classes of interest, then object menu;
              only the first letter ('T','C','P','F') matters; 'N' (None)
              is a synonym for 'T', as is boolean style negation  [Full]
packorder     a list of default symbols for kinds of objects that gives the
              order in which your pack will be displayed  [")[%?+!=/(*`0_]
              (If you specify only some kinds of items, the others from the
              default order will be appended to the end.)
pickup_burden when you pick up an item that exceeds this encumberance
              level (Unburdened, Burdened, streSsed, straiNed, overTaxed,
              or overLoaded), you will be asked if you want to continue. [S]
pickup_types  a list of default symbols for kinds of objects to autopickup
              when that option is on  [all]
scores        the parts of the score list you wish to see when the game ends
              You choose a combination of top scores, scores around the top
              scores, and all of your own scores.  [!own/3 top/2 around]
suppress_alert disable various version-specific warnings about changes
              in game play or the user interface, such as notification given
              for the 'Q' command that quitting is now done via #quit
              (e.g., use suppress_alert:3.3.1 to stop that and any other
              notifications added in that version or earlier) default: (none)

Compound options which may be set only on startup are:

align      Your starting alignment (align:lawful, align:neutral,
           or align:chaotic).  You may specify just the first letter.  [RANDOM]
catname    the name of your first cat  [NONE]
dogname    the name of your first dog  [NONE]
dungeon    a list of symbols to be used in place of the default ones for
           drawing the dungeon.
           The symbols are subjected to a fair amount of processing, so
           that you can use C-style escapes such as \n or \081 as well as
           indicate control characters by ^x or meta characters by \Mx.
           As usual, \ can force the next character to be taken literally.
           Since many of the default symbols are overloaded, they are
           given here by name instead of symbol, with some added notes:
           stone                               (solid rock, normally ' ')
           vwall hwall tlcorn trcorn blcorn brcorn      (room boundaries)

           air cloud water
           default:  \ |--------||.-|++##.##<><>_\\#{}.}..##\ #}

           ss1 ss2 ss3 ss4                           (shielding sequence)

           exml exmm exmr                   (explosion matrix middle row)
           exbl exbm exbr                   (explosion matrix bottom row)
           default:  |-\\/*!)(0#@*/-\\||\\-//-\\|\ |\\-/
gender     Your starting gender (gender:male or gender:female).
           You may specify just the first letter.  Although you can
           still denote your gender using the "male" and "female"
           options, the "gender" option will take precedence.  [RANDOM]
horsename  the name of your first horse  [NONE]
menu_*     create single character accelerators for menu commands.  Below
           is a list of all commands.  Each is followed by a list of window-

           'a' is Amiga.

           is recommended that you spell out as much of the role name
           as possible.  You can also still denote your role by
           appending it to the "name" option (e.g., name:Vic-V), but the
           "role" option will take precedence.  [RANDOM]

           arrow_trap dart_trap falling_rock_trap squeaky_board
           bear_trap land_mine rolling_boulder_trap sleeping_gas_trap
