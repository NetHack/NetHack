There are further boolean options controlled by compilation flags.

Boolean option if INSURANCE was set at compile time:

           recovery after program crash

Boolean option if NEWS was set at compile time:
news       print any news from game administrator on startup      [TRUE]

Boolean option if MFLOPPY was set at compile time:
checkspace check free disk space before writing files to disk     [TRUE]


Boolean option if SCORE_ON_BOTL was set at compile time:
showscore  display your approximate accumulated score             [FALSE]

Boolean options if TEXTCOLOR was set at compile time:
color      use different colors for objects on screen   [TRUE for micros]
hilite_pet display pets in a highlighted manner                   [FALSE]

Boolean option if TIMED_DELAY was set at compile time (tty interface only):
timed_delay    on unix and VMS, use a timer instead of sending
               extra screen output when attempting to pause for
               display effect.  on MSDOS without the termcap
               lib, whether or not to pause for visual effect.    [TRUE]

Boolean option for Amiga, or for others if ALTMETA was set at compile time:
altmeta        For Amiga, treat Alt+key as Meta+key.              [TRUE]
altmeta        For unix and VMS, treat two character sequence

               obtains a command from player's keyboard.          [FALSE]

Boolean option if USE_TILES was set at compile time (MSDOS protected mode only):
preload_tiles  control whether tiles get pre-loaded into RAM at the
               start of the game.  Doing so enhances performance
               of the tile graphics, but uses more memory.        [TRUE]

Any Boolean option can be negated by prefixing it with a '!' or 'no'.


Compound options are written as option_name:option_value.

Compound options which can be set during the game are:

              Partial     -- skip class filtering, use menu of all items;
              only the first letter ('T','C','P','F') matters; 'N' (None)

               0 -- traditional hjkl + yubn movement (default);
               1 -- digits control movement, for use with numeric keypad;
               2 -- same as 1, but '5' works as 'g' prefix rather than 'G';
               3 -- numeric for phone keypad (1,2,3 above, 7,8,9 below);
               4 -- phone keypad (3) combined with MSDOS compatibility (2);
              -1 -- alphabetic movement but 'z' swapped with 'y'.  [0]

              order in which your pack will be displayed  [")[%?+!=/(*`0_]

              default order will be appended to the end.)
paranoid_confirmation  space separated list of situations where alternate
              prompting is desired  [paranoid_confirmation:pray]
              Confirm -- when requiring yes, also require no to reject

              level (Unencumbered, Burdened, streSsed, straiNed, overTaxed,

pickup_types  a list of default symbols for kinds of objects to autopickup
              when that option is on  [all]

              listing the objects.  (0 means "always list objects.")  [5]
runmode       controls how often the map window is updated when performing
              multi-step movement (various running modes or travel command):
              teleport -- don't update map until movement stops;
              run      -- periodically update map (interval is seven steps);
              walk     -- update map after every step;
              crawl    -- like walk, but delay after making each step.
              (This only affects screen display, not actual movement.)  [run]
scores        the parts of the score list you wish to see when the game ends
              You choose a combination of top scores, scores around the top
              scores, and all of your own scores.  [!own/3 top/2 around]
suppress_alert disable various version-specific warnings about changes
              in game play or the user interface, such as notification given
              for the 'Q' command that quitting is now done via #quit
              (e.g., use suppress_alert:3.3.1 to stop that and any other
              notifications added in that version or earlier) default: [(none)]
whatis_coord  controls whether to include map coordinates when autodescribe
              is active for the '/' and ';' commands.  Value is the first
              letter of one of
              compass -- ('east' or '3s' or '2n,4w')
              map     -- <x,y>        (map column x=0 is not used)
              screen  -- [row,column] (row is offset to match tty usage)
              none    -- no coordinates shown; default: [n]

Compound options which may be set only on startup are:

align      Your starting alignment (align:lawful, align:neutral,
           or align:chaotic).  You may specify just the first letter.  [RANDOM]
catname    the name of your first cat  [NONE]
dogname    the name of your first dog  [NONE]
gender     Your starting gender (gender:male or gender:female).
           You may specify just the first letter.  Although you can
           still denote your gender using the "male" and "female"
           options, the "gender" option will take precedence.  [RANDOM]
horsename  the name of your first horse  [NONE]
menu_*     create single character accelerators for menu commands.  Below
           is a list of all commands.  Each is followed by a list of window-
           ports that implement them:  'x' is X11, 't' is tty, 'g' is Gem,
           'a' is Amiga.

           menu_select_page   select all items on this menu page [,](gta)
msghistory number of top line messages to save [20]
name       the name of your character  [obtained by asking the system or
           the player]

playmode   normal play or non-scoring explore mode or debug mode  [normal]
race       Your starting race (e.g., race:Human, race:Elf).  [RANDOM]
role       Your starting role (e.g., role:Barbarian, role:Valk).
           Although you can specify just the first letter(s), it will
           choose only the first role it finds that matches; thus, it
           is recommended that you spell out as much of the role name
           as possible.  You can also still denote your role by
           appending it to the "name" option (e.g., name:Vic-V), but the
           "role" option will take precedence.  [RANDOM]

windowtype windowing system to be used  [depends on operating system]

Compound option if TTY_GRAPHICS was set at compile time:
msg_window the type of message window to use:
           single      -- One message at a time
           full        -- Full window with all saved top line messages
           reverse     -- Same as full, but messages printed most-recent-first
           combination -- Two single messages, then as full
           default:  single

Some sample options lists are:
!autopickup,!tombstone,name:Gandalf,scores:own/3 top/2 around
