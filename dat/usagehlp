This is a terse description of nethack's command line arguments.
It is oriented toward UNIX (including descendants such as linux and macOS)
and might not be accurate for other platforms.

When starting play, if there is a save file for the chosen character name
then it will be restored, otherwise a new game using that name will begin.

nethack
  with no arguments; uses character name from run-time configuration file's
  OPTIONS=name:character-name entry, or player's username if none.

nethack -u character-name [-X or -D]
  '-u character-name' specifies the name to use for this game's character;
       -u must be lowercase; the space between it and character-name may
       be omitted;
  '-X' play in non-scoring explore mode also known as discovery mode;
       -X must be uppercase; character starts with a wand of wishing and
       player may opt to be life-saved and keep going if character dies;
  '-D' run in debug mode also known as wizard mode; -D must be uppercase;
       if player is not allowed then nethack will switch to -X; if player
       is allowed, character name will be changed to "wizard".

  A character name may have a suffix specifying any or all of role, race,
  gender, and alignment such as -u Conan-Bar-Hum-Mal-Neu or -u Tim-Wiz.
  The components present must be at least three letters long but can be
  longer; their case doesn't matter.  See also -p and -r, next,

nethack -p Ppp -r Rrr [-@]
  '-p Ppp' specify role; p for "profession" is used because -r is in use;
       'Ppp' is three or more letters of the role name such as Val for
       Valkyrie; unlike -p itself, upper/lower case of Ppp doesn't matter
  '-r Rrr' specify race or species: Hum[an], Elf, Orc, Dwa[rf], Gno[me];
  '-@' force non-interactive start; any of role, race, gender, and
       alignment that is not specified on the command line or in the
       run-time configuration file gets chosen randomly without prompting;
       the at-sign might need to be quoted by preceding it with backslash.

  The old form for role is also still accepted:  -A or -Arc[heologist],
  -B or -Bar[barian], -C or -Cav[eman] or -Cavew[oman], -H or -Hea[ler],
  -K or -Kni[ght], -M or -Mon[k], -P or -Pri[est] or -Prieste[ss],
  -Ran[ger], -R or -Rog[ue], -S or -Sam[urai], -T or -Tou[rist],
  -V or -Val[kyrie], -W or -Wiz[ard].  The single-letter form must be in
  uppercase, the three or more letter form can be in any case.  There is
  no single-letter option for the Ranger role.

nethack -DEC[graphics]
nethack -IBM[graphics]
  selects the DEC or IBM symbol set to use line-drawing characters on a
  text map; might be ignored depending on interface, or ineffective or
  even scrambled depending on display capability; -DECgraphics and
  -IBMgraphics are mutually exclusive; they can be any case but must use
  at least three letters.

nethack -wIii
nethack --windowtype:Iii
  where 'Iii' represents an interface designation:  tty, curses, X11, or
  Qt; only useful if the program was built to support more than one
  interface (the game's '#version' command will disclose that); overrides
  OPTIONS=windowtype:Iii in run-time configuration file and build-time
  default; '-w' or '--windowtype' must be lowercase, the interface
  designation itself may be any case; variations '--windowtype Iii' and
  '-w Iii' work too.

  On Windows, nethack.exe might support both tty and curses; nethackW.exe
  supports mswin only.  MS-DOS is tty only.

nethack -n
  don't show the 'news' file if one is present in nethack's directory.

nethack --nethackrc:RC-file
  use RC-file instead of the default run-time configuration file (which is
  usually '~/.nethackrc'); the file name should include full path unless
  located in nethack's directory;
nethack --no-nethackrc
  don't use any run-time configuration file; equivalent to
  --nethackrc:/dev/null which behaves as if an empty file.

nethack -dDir
nethack --directory:Dir
  could be used to override the build-time value of NETHACKDIR with
  location Dir; if used, it should precede other command line arguments.

The assorted options above can be combined on a single command line;
they're listed separately for readability.

*******

Other options which perform some action and then exit rather than play
the game:

nethack -s
nethack --scores
  show scores for the default character; optional additional arguments:
nethack -s -v
  show scores for all versions present in the high scores file (record)
  if it contains scores for any older versions; by default, only scores
  for current version of nethack are shown; when '-v' is used, it should
  immediately follow -s or --scores, preceding any name(s) or -p or -r;
nethack -s character-name [character-name2 [character-name3 [...]]]
  show scores for one or more specific character names (might not be
  effective if PERS_IS_UID=1 is specified in nethack's sysconf file);
  character names may be preceded by '-u' but that isn't required;
  special character-name "all" is used to display all scores that pass
  other criteria;
nethack -s -p Ppp -r Rrr
  show scores for specific roles or races; multiple instances can be used;
  if both '-p' and '-r' are used, scores that match either will be shown
  rather than scores that match both;
nethack -dDir -s
nethack --directory:Dir -s
  as above; alternate directory, if specified, should come first.

nethack --version
nethack --version:paste
  '--version' display the program's version number and exit;
  '--version:paste' display version number and also copy it into system
  pasteboard (should work on macOS and Windows; might not work on other
  systems) so that it could be copied from there into a subsequent email
  or web contact form, then exit.

nethack --showpaths
  list expected locations for various files and directories, then exit;
  includes the name and location for the run-time configuration file which
  can vary from platform to platform.

nethack --usage
nethack --help
  show this text; 'nethack -?' and 'nethack ?' also work but the question
  mark may need to be quoted to prevent the shell from intercepting it.

*******

This text is available during play in the menu for the game's '?' command
or can be viewed via 'nethack --usage | more' at the shell prompt.
