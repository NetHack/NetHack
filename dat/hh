y k u   7 8 9   Move commands:
 \|/     \|/            yuhjklbn: go one step in specified direction
h-.-l   4-.-6           YUHJKLBN: go in specified direction until you
 /|\     /|\                        hit a wall or run into something
b j n   1 2 3           g<dir>:   run in direction <dir> until something
      numberpad                     interesting is seen
                        G<dir>,   same, except a branching corridor isn't
 <  up                  ^<dir>:     considered interesting (the ^ in this
                                    case means the Control key, not a caret)
 >  down                m<dir>:   move without picking up objects/fighting
                        F<dir>:   fight even if you don't sense a monster
                If the number_pad option is set, the digit keys move instead.
                Depending on the platform, Shift digit (on the numberpad),
                Meta digit, or Alt digit will invoke the YUHJKLBN commands.
                Control <dir> may or may not work when number_pad is enabled,
                depending on the platform's capabilities.
                Digit '5' acts as 'G' prefix, unless number_pad is set to 2
                in which case it acts as 'g' instead.
                If number_pad is set to 3, the roles of 1,2,3 and 7,8,9 are
                reversed; when set to 4, behaves same as 3 combined with 2.
                If number_pad is set to -1, alphabetic movement commands are
                used but 'y' and 'z' are swapped.

#quit quit      end the game without saving current game
S     save      save the game (to be continued later) and exit

Control characters are depicted as '^' followed by a letter.  Depress Ctrl
or Control like a shift key then type the letter.  Control characters are
case-insensitive; ^D is the same as ^d, Ctrl+d is same as Ctrl+Shift+d.
There are a few non-letter control characters; nethack uses ^[ as a synonym
for Escape (or vice versa) and ^_ for #retravel but none of the others.

                that monster; for a pile of objects, only describes top one)

Keyboards that have a meta key (some use Alt for that, so typing Alt as a
shift plus 'e' would generate 'M-e') can also use these extended commands
via the meta modifier as an alternative to using the # prefix.  Unlike
control characters, meta characters are case-sensitive so M-a is different
from M-A.  Type the latter with two keys used as shifts, Meta+Shift+a.

If the 'number_pad' option is on, keys usually used for movement can be
used for various commands:

n               followed by number of times to repeat the next command
h     help      display one of several informative texts, like '?'
