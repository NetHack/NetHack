y k u   7 8 9   Move commands:
 \|/     \|/            yuhjklbn: go one step in specified direction
h-.-l   4-.-6           YUHJKLBN: go in specified direction until you
 /|\     /|\                        hit a wall or run into something
b j n   1 2 3           g<dir>:   run in direction <dir> until something
      numberpad                     interesting is seen
                        G<dir>,   same, except a branching corridor isn't
 <  up                  ^<dir>:     considered interesting (the ^ in this
                                    case means the Control key, not a caret)
 >  down                m<dir>:   move without picking up objects/fighting
                        F<dir>:   fight even if you don't sense a monster
                If the number_pad option is set, the number keys move instead.
                Depending on the platform, Shift number (on the numberpad),
                Meta number, or Alt number will invoke the YUHJKLBN commands.
                Control <dir> may or may not work when number_pad is enabled,
                depending on the platform's capabilities.
                Digit '5' acts as 'G' prefix, unless number_pad is set to 2
                in which case it acts as 'g' instead.
                If number_pad is set to 3, the roles of 1,2,3 and 7,8,9 are
                reversed; when set to 4, behaves same as 3 combined with 2.
                If number_pad is set to -1, alphabetic movement commands are
                used but 'y' and 'z' are swapped.
