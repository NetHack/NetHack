%title The Colour of Magic  (2)
%passage 1
The Colour of Magic, by Terry Pratchett

It has been remarked before that those who are sensitive to radiation in the
far octarine - the eighth colour, the pigment of the Imagination - can see
things that others cannot.

Thus it was that Rincewind, hurrying through the crowded, flare-lit, evening
bazarrs of Morpork with the Luggage trundling behind him, jostled a tall
figure, turned to deliver a few suitable curses, and beheld Death.

It had to be Death.  No-one else went around with empty eye sockets and, of
course, the scythe over one shoulder was another clue.

%passage 2
The Colour of Magic, by Terry Pratchett

As he was drawn towards the Eye the terror-struck Rincewind raised the box
protectively, and at the same time heard the picture imp say, 'They're about
ripe now, can't hold them any longer.  Every-one smile, please.'

There was a -
- flash of light so white and so bright - 
- it didn't seem like light at all.

Bel-Shamharoth screamed, a sound that started in the far ultrasonic and
finished somewhere in Rincewind's bowels.  The tentacles went momentarily as
stiff as rods, hurling their various cargos around the room, before bunching
up protectively in front of the abused Eye.  The whole mass dropped into the
pit and a moment later the big slab was snatched up by several dozen tentacles
and slammed into place, leaving a number of thrashing limbs trapped around the
edge.

%passage 1
The Light Fantastic, by Terry Pratchett

'Cohen is my name, boy' Belthan's hands stopped moving.
'Cohen?' she said, 'Cohen the Barbarian?'
'The very shame.'
'Hang on, hang on,' said Rincewind, 'Cohen's a great big chap, neck like a bull,
got chest muscles like a sack of footballs.  I mean, he's the Disc's greatest
warrior, a legend in his own lifetime.  I remember my grandad telling me he saw
him ... my grandad telling me he ... my grandad ...'
He faltered under the gimlit gaze.
'Oh,' he said, 'Oh. Of course, Sorry.'
'Yesh,' said Cohen, and sighed, 'Thatsh right boy, I'm a lifetime in my own
legend.'

%passage 2
The Light Fantastic, by Terry Pratchett

Death sat at one side of a black baize table in the entre of the room, arguing
with Famine, War and Pestilence.  Twoflower was the only one to look up and
notice Rincewind.
'Hey, how did you get here?' he said.
'Well, some say that the creator took a handful - oh, I see, well, it's hard to
explain but I -'
'Have you got the Luggage?'
The wooden box pushed past Rincewind and settled down in front of its owner,
who opened its lid and rummaged around inside until he came up with a small,
leatherbound book which he handed to War, who was hammering the table with a
mailed fist.
'It's "Nosehinger on the Laws of Contract",' he said. 'It's quite good, there's
a lot in it about double finessing and how to -'
Death snatched the book with a bony hand anflipped through the pages, quite
oblivious to the presence of the two men.
'RIGHT,' he said, 'PESTILENCE, OPEN ANOTHER PACK OF CARDS. I'M GOING TO GET TO
THE GOTTOM OF THIS IF IT KILLS ME. FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING OF COURSE.'

%title Eric (2)
%passage 1
  No enemies had ever taken Ankh-Morpork. Well, /technically/ they had, quite often; the city welcomed free-spending barbarian invaders, but somehow the puzzled raiders always found, after a few days, that they didn't own their own horses any more, and within a couple of months they were just another minority group with its own graffiti and food shops.
    [Terry Pratchett, Eric]

%passage 2
  Rincewind looked down at the broad steps they were climbing. They were something of a novelty; each one was built out of large stone letters. The one he was just stepping on to, for example, read: I Meant It For The Best.
  The next one was: I Thought You'd Like It.
  Eric was standing on: For The Sake Of The Children.
  'Weird, isn't it?' he said. 'Why do it like this?'
  'I think they're meant to be good intentions,' said Rincewind. This was a road to hell, and demons were, after all, traditionalists.

  This is space. It's sometimes called the final frontier.

  By and large, the only skill the alchemists of Ankh-Morpork had discovered so far was the ability to turn gold into less gold.

%passage 3
  There was a dog sitting by his feet.
  It was small, bow-legged and wiry, and basically grey but with patches of brown, white, and black in outlying areas...
  It looked up slowly, and said 'Woof?'
  Victor poked an exploratory finger in his ear. It must have been a trick of an echo, or something. It wasn't that the dog had gone 'woof!', although that was practically unique in itself; most dogs in the universe /never/ went 'woof!', they had complicated barks like 'whuuugh!' and 'hwhoouf!'. No, it was that it hadn't in fact /barked/ at all. It had /said/ 'woof'.
  'Could have bin worse, mister. I could have said "miaow".'

  'Maybe you could... help us?'
  'What's wrong?'
  'It's my boy...'
  Granny opened the door further and saw the womand standing behind Mr. Slot. One look at her face was enough. There was a bundle in her arms.
  Granny stepped back. 'Bring him in and let me have a look at him.'
  She took the baby from the woman, sat down on the room's one chair, and pulled back the blanket.
  'Hmm,' said Granny, after a while.
  'There's a curse on this house, that's what it is,' said Slot. 'My best cow's been taken mortally sick, too.'
  'Oh? You have a cowshed?' siad Granny. 'Very good place for a sick-room, a cowshed. It's the warmth. You better show me were it is.'
  'You want to take the boy down there?'
  'Right now.'
  [...]
  'How many have you come for?'
  ONE.
  'The cow?'
  Death shook his head.
  'It could be the cow.'
  NO. THAT WOULD BE CHANGING HISTORY.
  'History is about things changing.'
  NO.
  Granny sat back.
  'Then I challenge you to a game. That's traditional. That's /allowed/.'
  Death was silent for a moment.
  THIS IS TRUE.
  'Good.'
  HOWEVER... YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TO WIN ALL YOU MUST GAMBLE ALL?
  'Double or quits? Yes, I know.'
  BUT NOT CHESS.
  'Can't abide chess.'
  OR CRIPPLE MR ONION. I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE RULES.
  'Very well. How about one hand of poker? Five cards each, no draws? Sudden death, as they say.'
  Death thought about this, too.
  YOU KNOW THIS FAMILY?
  'No.'
  THEN WHY?
  'Are we talking or are we playing?'
  OH, VERY WELL.
  Granny looked at her cards, and threw them down.
  FOUR QUEENS. HMM. THAT /IS/ VERY HIGH.
  Death looked down at his cards, and then up into Granny's steady, blue-eyed gaze.
  Neither moved for some time.
  Then Death laid the hand on the table.
  I LOSE. ALL I HAVE IS FOUR ONES.

  Agnes had woken up one morning with the horrible realization that she'd been saddled with a lovely personality. It was the lack of choice that rankled. No one had asked her, before she was born, whether she wanted a lovely personality or whether she'd prefer, say, a miserable personality but a body that could take size 9 in dresses. Instead, people would take pains to tell her that beauty was only skin-deep, as if a man ever fell for an attractive pair of kidneys.

  'Well, /gentlemen/, would you like some wine?'

Rumour is information distilled so finely that it can filter through anything. 
It does not need doors and windows -- sometimes it does not need people. 
It can exist free and wild, running from ear to ear without ever touching lips.

It was so much easier to blame it on Them. It was bleakly depressing to think that They were Us. 
If it was Them, then nothing was anyone's fault. If it was us, what did that make Me? 
After all, I'm one of Us. I must be. I've certainly never thought of myself as one of Them. 
No one ever thinks of themselves as one of Them. We're always one of Us. 
It's Them that do the bad things.

There are, it has been said, two types of people in the world. There are those

half full. And then there are those who say: this glass is half empty.

The world belongs, however, to those who can look at the glass and say: What's
up with this glass?  Excuse me?  Excuse me?  This is may glass?  I don't think
so. My glass was full! And it was a bigger glass!  Who's been pinching my beer?

  The Watch armour fitted like a glove. He'd have preferred it to fit like a helmet and breastplate. It was common knowledge that the Watch's approach to uniforms was one-size-doesn't-exactly-fit-anybody, and that Commander Vimes disapproved of armour that didn't have that kicked-by-trolls look. He liked it to make it clear that it had been doing its job.

  'Surely not!'
  'If you were shipwrecked on a desert island, what would you prefer, a bag of potatoes or a bag of gold?'
  'Yes, but a desert island isn't Ankh-Morpork!'
  'And that proves gold is only valuable because we agree it is, right? It's just a dream. But a potato is always worth a potato, anywhere. A knob of butter and a pinch of salt and you've got a meal, /anywhere/. Bury gold in the ground and you'll be worrying about thieves for ever. Bury a potato and in due season you could be looking at a dividend of a thousand per cent.'
