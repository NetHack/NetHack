NetHack History file for release 3.7

Behold, mortal, the origins of NetHack...

Jay Fenlason wrote the original Hack, with help from Kenny Woodland,
Mike Thome, and Jon Payne.

Andries Brouwer did a major re-write while at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum
(now Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica), transforming Hack into a very different
game.  He published the Hack source code for use on UNIX(tm) systems by
posting that to Usenet newsgroup net.sources (later renamed comp.sources)
releasing version 1.0 in December of 1984, then versions 1.0.1, 1.0.2, and
finally 1.0.3 in July of 1985.  Usenet newsgroup net.games.hack (later
renamed rec.games.hack, eventually replaced by rec.games.roguelike.nethack)
was created for discussing it.

Don G. Kneller ported Hack 1.0.3 to Microsoft(tm) C and MS-DOS(tm), producing
PC HACK 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics in version 1.03g, and
went on to produce at least four more versions (3.0, 3.2, 3.51, and 3.6;
note that these are old Hack version numbers, not contemporary NetHack ones).

R. Black ported PC HACK 3.51 to Lattice(tm) C and the Atari 520/1040ST,
producing ST Hack 1.03.

Mike Stephenson merged these various versions back together, incorporating
many of the added features, and produced NetHack version 1.4 in 1987.  He
then coordinated a cast of thousands in enhancing and debugging NetHack 1.4
and released NetHack versions 2.2 and 2.3.  Like Hack, they were released by
posting their source code to Usenet where they remained available in various
archives accessible via ftp and uucp after expiring from the newsgroup.

Later, Mike coordinated a major re-write of the game, heading a team which
included Ken Arromdee, Jean-Christophe Collet, Steve Creps, Eric Hendrickson,
Izchak Miller, Eric S. Raymond, John Rupley, Mike Threepoint, and Janet Walz,
to produce NetHack 3.0c.

NetHack 3.0 was ported to the Atari by Eric R. Smith, to OS/2 by Timo
Hakulinen, and to VMS by David Gentzel.  The three of them and Kevin Darcy
later joined the main NetHack Development Team to produce subsequent
revisions of 3.0.

Olaf Seibert ported NetHack 2.3 and 3.0 to the Amiga.  Norm Meluch, Stephen
Spackman and Pierre Martineau designed overlay code for PC NetHack 3.0.
Johnny Lee ported NetHack 3.0 to the Macintosh.  Along with various other
Dungeoneers, they continued to enhance the PC, Macintosh, and Amiga ports
through the later revisions of 3.0.

Version 3.0 went through ten relatively rapidly released "patch-level"
revisions.  Versions at the time were known as 3.0 for the base release
and variously as "3.0a" through "3.0j", "3.0 patchlevel 1" through
"3.0 patchlevel 10", or "3.0pl1" through "3.0pl10" rather than 3.0.0 and
3.0.1 through 3.0.10; the three component numbering scheme began to be used
with 3.1.0.

Headed by Mike Stephenson and coordinated by Izchak Miller and Janet Walz,
the NetHack Development Team which now included Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs,
Jean-Christophe Collet, Kevin Darcy, Matt Day, Timo Hakulinen, Steve Linhart,
Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Raymond, and Eric Smith undertook a radical
revision of 3.0.  They re-structured the game's design, and re-wrote major
parts of the code.  They added multiple dungeons, a new display, special
individual character quests, a new endgame and many other new features, and
produced NetHack 3.1.  Version 3.1.0 was released in January of 1993.

Ken Lorber, Gregg Wonderly and Greg Olson, with help from Richard Addison,
Mike Passaretti, and Olaf Seibert, developed NetHack 3.1 for the Amiga.

Norm Meluch and Kevin Smolkowski, with help from Carl Schelin, Stephen
Spackman, Steve VanDevender, and Paul Winner, ported NetHack 3.1 to the PC.

Jon W{tte and Hao-yang Wang, with help from Ross Brown, Mike Engber, David
Hairston, Michael Hamel, Jonathan Handler, Johnny Lee, Tim Lennan, Rob Menke,
and Andy Swanson, developed NetHack 3.1 for the Macintosh, porting it for
MPW.  Building on their development, Bart House added a Think C port.

Timo Hakulinen ported NetHack 3.1 to OS/2.  Eric Smith ported NetHack 3.1
to the Atari.  Pat Rankin, with help from Joshua Delahunty, was responsible
for the VMS version of NetHack 3.1.  Michael Allison ported NetHack 3.1 to
Windows NT.

Dean Luick, with help from David Cohrs, developed NetHack 3.1 for X11.
It drew the map as text rather than graphically but included nh10.bdf, an
optionally used custom X11 font which has tiny images in place of letters and
punctuation, a precursor of tiles.  Those images don't extend to individual
monster and object types, just replacements for monster and object classes
(so one custom image for all "a" insects and another for all "[" armor and
so forth, not separate images for beetles and ants or for cloaks and boots).

Warwick Allison wrote a graphically displayed version of NetHack for the
Atari where the tiny pictures were described as "icons" and were distinct
for specific types of monsters and objects rather than just their classes.
He contributed them to the NetHack Development Team which rechristened them
"tiles", original usage which has subsequently been picked up by various
other games.  NetHack's tiles support was then implemented on other platforms
(initially MS-DOS but eventually Windows, Qt, and X11 too).

The 3.2 NetHack Development Team, comprised of Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee,
David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Steve Creps, Kevin Darcy, Timo Hakulinen, Steve
Linhart, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Smith, Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz,
and Paul Winner, released version 3.2.0 in April of 1996.

Version 3.2 marked the tenth anniversary of the formation of the development
team.  In a testament to their dedication to the game, all thirteen members
of the original NetHack Development Team remained on the team at the start
of work on that release.  During the interval between the release of 3.1.3
and 3.2.0, one of the founding members of the NetHack Development Team,
Dr. Izchak Miller, was diagnosed with cancer and passed away.  That release
of the game was dedicated to him by the development and porting teams.

Version 3.2 proved to be more stable than previous versions.  Many bugs
were fixed, abuses eliminated, and game features tuned for better game
play.

During the lifespan of NetHack 3.1 and 3.2, several enthusiasts of the game
added their own modifications to the game and made these "variants" publicly
available:

Tom Proudfoot and Yuval Oren created NetHack++, which was quickly renamed
NetHack-- when some people incorrectly assumed that it was a conversion
of the C source code to C++.  Working independently, Stephen White wrote
NetHack Plus.  Tom Proudfoot later merged NetHack Plus and his own NetHack--
to produce SLASH.  Larry Stewart-Zerba and Warwick Allison improved the
spell casting system with the Wizard Patch.  Warwick Allison also ported
NetHack to use the Qt interface.

Warren Cheung combined SLASH with the Wizard Patch to produce Slash'EM, and
with the help of Kevin Hugo, added more features.  Kevin later joined the
NetHack Development Team and incorporated the best of these ideas into
NetHack 3.3.

The final update to 3.2 was the bug fix release 3.2.3, which was released
simultaneously with 3.3.0 in December 1999 just in time for the Year 2000.
Because of the newer version, 3.2.3 was released as a source code patch only,
without any ready-to-play distribution for systems that usually had such.

(To anyone considering resurrecting an old version:  all versions before
3.2.3 had a Y2K bug.  The high scores file and the log file contained dates
which were formatted using a two-digit year, and 1999's year 99 was followed
by 2000's year 100.  That got written out successfully but it unintentionally
introduced an extra column in the file layout which prevented score entries
from being read back in correctly, interfering with insertion of new high
scores and with retrieval of old character names to use for random ghost and
statue names in the current game.)

The 3.3 NetHack Development Team, consisting of Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee,
David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Steve Creps, Kevin Darcy, Timo Hakulinen,
Kevin Hugo, Steve Linhart, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Smith,
Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner, released 3.3.0 in
December 1999 and 3.3.1 in August of 2000.

Version 3.3 offered many firsts.  It was the first version to separate race
and profession.  The Elf class was removed in preference to an elf race,
and the races of dwarves, gnomes, and orcs made their first appearance in
the game alongside the familiar human race.  Monk and Ranger roles joined
Archeologists, Barbarians, Cavemen, Healers, Knights, Priests, Rogues,
Samurai, Tourists, Valkyries and of course, Wizards.  It was also the first
version to allow you to ride a steed, and was the first version to have a
publicly available web-site listing all the bugs that had been discovered.
Despite that constantly growing bug list, 3.3 proved stable enough to last
for more than a year and a half.

The 3.4 NetHack Development Team initially consisted of Michael Allison,
Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Kevin Hugo, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick,
Pat Rankin, Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner, with Warwick Allison
joining just before the release of NetHack 3.4.0 in March 2002.

As with version 3.3, various people contributed to the game as a whole as
well as supporting ports on the different platforms that NetHack runs on:

Pat Rankin maintained 3.4 for VMS.

Michael Allison maintained NetHack 3.4 for the MS-DOS platform.
Paul Winner and Yitzhak Sapir provided encouragement.

Dean Luick, Mark Modrall, and Kevin Hugo maintained and enhanced the
Macintosh port of 3.4.

Michael Allison, David Cohrs, Alex Kompel, Dion Nicolaas, and Yitzhak Sapir
maintained and enhanced 3.4 for the Microsoft Windows platform.  Alex Kompel
contributed a new graphical interface for the Windows port.  Alex Kompel also
contributed a Windows CE port for 3.4.1.

Ron Van Iwaarden maintained 3.4 for OS/2.

Janne Salmijarvi and Teemu Suikki maintained and enhanced the
Amiga port of 3.4 after Janne Salmijarvi resurrected it for 3.3.1.

Christian "Marvin" Bressler maintained 3.4 for the Atari after he
resurrected it for 3.3.1.

The release of NetHack 3.4.3 in December 2003 marked the beginning of a
long release hiatus.  3.4.3 proved to be a remarkably stable version that
provided continued enjoyment by the community for more than a decade.  The
NetHack Development Team slowly and quietly continued to work on the game
behind the scenes during the tenure of 3.4.3.  It was during that same
period that several new variants emerged within the NetHack community.
Notably sporkhack by Derek S. Ray, unnethack by Patric Mueller, nitrohack
and its successors originally by Daniel Thaler and then by Alex Smith, and
Dynahack by Tung Nguyen.  Some of those variants continue to be developed,
maintained, and enjoyed by the community to this day.

In September 2014, an interim snapshot of the code under development was
released publicly by other parties.  Since that code was a work-in-progress
and had not gone through the process of debugging it as a suitable release,
it was decided that the version numbers present on that code snapshot would
be retired and never used in an official NetHack release.  An announcement
was posted on the NetHack Development Team's official nethack.org website
to that effect, stating that there would never be a 3.4.4, 3.5, or 3.5.0
official release version.

In January 2015, preparation began for the release of NetHack 3.6.

At the beginning of development for what would eventually get released
as 3.6.0, the NetHack Development Team consisted of Warwick Allison,
Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Ken Lorber,
Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner.
In early 2015, ahead of the release of 3.6.0, new members Sean Hunt,
Pasi Kallinen, and Derek S. Ray joined the NetHack Development Team.

Near the end of the development of 3.6.0, one of the significant inspirations
for many of the humorous and fun features found in the game, author
Terry Pratchett, passed away.  NetHack 3.6.0 introduced a tribute to him.

3.6.0 was released in December 2015, and merged work done by the development
team since the release of 3.4.3 with some of the beloved community patches.
Many bugs were fixed and some code was restructured.

The NetHack Development Team, as well as Steve VanDevender and
Kevin Smolkowski, ensured that NetHack 3.6 continued to operate on various
UNIX flavors and maintained the X11 interface.

Ken Lorber, Haoyang Wang, Pat Rankin, and Dean Luick maintained the port
of NetHack 3.6 for Mac OSX.

Michael Allison, David Cohrs, Bart House, Pasi Kallinen, Alex Kompel,
Dion Nicolaas, Derek S. Ray and Yitzhak Sapir maintained the port of
NetHack 3.6 for Microsoft Windows.

Pat Rankin attempted to keep the VMS port running for NetHack 3.6,
hindered by limited access.  Kevin Smolkowski has updated and tested it
for the most recent version of OpenVMS (V8.4 as of this writing) on Alpha
and Integrity (aka Itanium aka IA64) but not VAX.

Ray Chason resurrected the MS-DOS port for 3.6 and contributed the
necessary updates to the community at large.

In late April 2018, several hundred bug fixes for 3.6.0 and some new
features were assembled and released as NetHack 3.6.1.
The NetHack Development Team at the time of release of 3.6.1 consisted of
Warwick Allison, Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs, Jessie Collet,
Pasi Kallinen, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Patric Mueller, Pat Rankin,
Derek S. Ray, Alex Smith, Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner.

In early May 2019, another 320 bug fixes along with some enhancements and
the adopted curses window port, were released as 3.6.2.

Bart House, who had contributed to the game as a porting team participant
for decades, joined the NetHack Development Team in late May 2019.

NetHack 3.6.3 was released on December 5, 2019 containing over 190 bug
fixes to NetHack 3.6.2.

NetHack 3.6.4 was released on December 18, 2019 containing a security
fix and a few bug fixes.

NetHack 3.6.5 was released on January 27, 2020 containing some security fixes
and a small number of bug fixes.

NetHack 3.6.6 was released on March 8, 2020 containing a security fix and
some bug fixes.

NetHack 3.6.7 was released on February 16, 2023 containing a security fix and
some bug fixes.

On behalf of the NetHack community, thank you very much once again  to
M.  Drew  Streib and Pasi Kallinen for providing a public NetHack server
at nethack.alt.org. Thanks to  Keith  Simpson  and Andy Thomson for
hardfought.org. Thanks to all those unnamed dungeoneers who invest their
time and  effort  into  annual  NetHack tournaments such as Junethack,
The November NetHack Tournament, and in days past, devnull.net (gone for
now, but not forgotten).
