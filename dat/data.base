abbot
	For it had been long apparent to Count Landulf that nothing
	could be done with his seventh son Thomas, except to make him
	an Abbot or something of that kind.  Born in 1226, he had from
	childhood a mysterious objection to becoming a predatory eagle,
	or even to taking an ordinary interest in falconry or tilting
	or any other gentlemanly pursuits.  He was a large and heavy and
	quiet boy, and phenomenally silent, scarcely opening his mouth
	except to say suddenly to his schoolmaster in an explosive
	manner, "What is God?"  The answer is not recorded but it is
	probable that the asker went on worrying out answers for himself.

suit or piece of armor
	"The last spot on the school jousting team came down to another
	boy and me.  He was poor, and his only armor was a blanket his
	mother had made him from her hair.  I, on the other hand, had
	a brand new suit of chain mail.  Just before our joust, I asked
	him what he'd do if he made the team.  (I was hoping to be more
	popular with the ladies.)  He said he would be able to save the
	town from dragons and be able to afford some water for his 20
	brothers and sisters.

	Well, a sense of compassion came over me.  I insisted we swap
	armor.  He was forced to accept, as it would have been an
	insult not to do so.

	On the battlefield, we charged at each other and we both connected
	with our lances.

	Lying there on the mud mortally wounded, I learned what true armor
	class was that day."

~agate ring
agate*
	Translucent, cryptocrystalline variety of quartz and a subvariety
	of chalcedony.  Agates are identical in chemical structure to
	jasper, flint, chert, petrified wood, and tiger's-eye, and are
	often found in association with opal.  The colorful, banded rocks
	are used as a semiprecious gemstone and in the manufacture of
	grinding equipment.  An agate's banding forms as silica from
	solution is slowly deposited into cavities and veins in older
	rock.

amulet of yendor
	This mysterious talisman is the object of your quest.  It is
	said to possess powers which mere mortals can scarcely

	He answered and said unto them, he that soweth the good seed
	is the Son of man; the field is the world, and the good seed
	are the children of the kingdom; but the weeds are the
	children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the

anhur
	An Egyptian god of war and a great hunter, few gods can match
	his fury.  Unlike many gods of war, he is a force for good.
	The wrath of Anhur is slow to come, but it is inescapable
	once earned.  Anhur is a mighty figure with four arms.  He
	is often seen with a powerful lance that requires both of
	his right arms to wield and which is tipped with a fragment
	of the sun.  He is married to Mehut, a lion-headed goddess.
ankh-morpork
	The twin city of Ankh-Morpork, foremost of all the cities
	bounding the Circle Sea, was as a matter of course the home
	of a large number of gangs, thieves' guilds, syndicates and
	similar organisations.  This was one of the reasons for its
	wealth.  Most of the humbler folk on the widdershin side of
	the river, in Morpork's mazy alleys, supplemented their
	meagre incomes by filling some small role for one or other
	of the competing gangs.

ashikaga takauji
	Ashikaga Takauji was a daimyo of the Minamoto clan who

	Later when Go-Daigo attempted to reduce the powers of the
	samurai clans he rebelled against him.  He defeated Go-
	Daigo and established the emperor Komyo on the throne.
	Go-Daigo eventually escaped and established another

asmodeus
	It is said that Asmodeus is the overlord over all of hell.
	His appearance, unlike many other demons and devils, is
	human apart from his horns and tail.  He can freeze flesh
	with a touch.
		[]

	The evil demon who appears in the Apocryphal book of _Tobit_
	and is derived from the Persian _Aeshma_.  In _Tobit_ Asmodeus
	falls in love with Sara, daughter of Raguel, and causes the
	death of seven husbands in succession, each on his bridal night.
	He was finally driven from Egypt through a charm made by Tobias
	of the heart and liver of a fish burned on perfumed ashes, as
	described by Milton in _Paradise Lost_ (IV, 167-71).  Hence
	Asmodeus often figures as the spirit of matrimonial jealousy
	or unhappiness.

athame
	The consecrated ritual knife of a Wiccan initiate (one of

bear*trap
	Probably most commonly associated with trapping, the leghold
	trap is a rather simple mechanical trap.  It is made up of two
	jaws, a spring of some sort, and a trigger in the middle.  When
	the animal steps on the trigger the trap closes around the leg,
	holding the animal in place.  Usually some kind of lure is used
	to position the animal, or the trap is set on an animal trail.
	Traditionally, leghold traps had tightly closing "teeth" to make
	sure the animal stayed in place.  The teeth also made sure the
	animal could not move the leg in the trap and ruin their fur.
	However, this resulted in many animals gnawing off legs in order
	to escape.  More modern traps have a gap called an "offset jaw"
	and work more like a handcuff.  They grip above the paw, making
	sure the animal cannot pull out but does not destroy the leg.
	This also allows the trapper to release unwanted catches.

	The blindfolding was performed by binding a piece of the

	to wear anything in particular made their dresses tightly round
	the eyes.  This linen I afterwards discovered was taken from the
	tombs, and was not, as I had first supposed, of native

	head, and finally brought down again and the ends bound under
	the chin to prevent its slipping.  Ustane was, by the way, also

	On waking, he found himself on the green knoll whence he had

	"I have not slept here all night."  He recalled the occurrences
	before he fell asleep.  The strange man with a keg of liquor --

boulder
	I worked the lever well under, and stretched my back; the end
	of the stone rose up, and I kicked the fulcrum under.  Then,
	when I was going to bear down, I remembered there was
	something to get out from below; when I let go of the lever,
	the stone would fall again.  I sat down to think, on the root
	of the oak tree; and, seeing it stand about the ground, I saw
	my way.  It was lucky I had brought a longer lever.  It would
	just reach to wedge under the oak root.
	Bearing it down so far would have been easy for a heavy man,
	but was a hard fight for me.  But this time I meant to do it
	if it killed me, because I knew it could be done.  Twice I
	got it nearly there, and twice the weight bore it up again;
	but when I flung myself on it the third time, I heard in my
	ears the sea-sound of Poseidon.  Then I knew this time I
	would do it; and so I did.

	then he would take a tiny nibble - just enough to allow the
	lovely sweet taste to spread out slowly over his tongue.  The

	the cat is killed.  If the event does not take place, the cat lives

	is indeed in a linear combination of being alive and dead, and only

	collapse into one or the other.  On the other hand, to a (suitably

*centaur
	Of all the monsters put together by the Greek imagination
	the Centaurs (Kentauroi) constituted a class in themselves.
	Despite a strong streak of sensuality, in their make-up,
	their normal behaviour was moral, and they took a kindly
	thought of man's welfare.  The attempted outrage of Nessos on
	Deianeira, and that of the whole tribe of Centaurs on the
	Lapith women, are more than offset by the hospitality of
	Pholos and by the wisdom of Cheiron, physician, prophet,
	lyrist, and the instructor of Achilles.  Further, the
	Centaurs were peculiar in that their nature, which united the
	body of a horse with the trunk and head of a man, involved
	an unthinkable duplication of vital organs and important
	members.  So grotesque a combination seems almost un-Greek.
	These strange creatures were said to live in the caves and
	clefts of the mountains, myths associating them especially
	with the hills of Thessaly and the range of Erymanthos.

	on the handle.  The lid creaked, then flew open.
	Dantes was seized with a sort of giddy fever.  He cocked his

	a child, opened them and stood dumbfounded.
	The chest was divided into three compartments.  In the first
	were shining gold coins.  In the second, unpolished gold

	Once in a great while, when the positions of the stars are

	to squat upon the egg, keeping it warm and helping it to
	hatch.  When it hatches, out comes a creature called basilisk,
	or cockatrice, the most deadly of all creatures.  A single
	glance from its yellow, piercing toad's eyes will kill both
	man and beast.  Its power of destruction is said to be so
	great that sometimes simply to hear its hiss can prove fatal.
	Its breath is so venomous that it causes all vegetation
	to wither.

	There is, however, one creature which can withstand the
	basilisk's deadly gaze, and this is the weasel.  No one knows
	why this is so, but although the fierce weasel can slay the
	basilisk, it will itself be killed in the struggle.  Perhaps
	the weasel knows the basilisk's fatal weakness:  if it ever
	sees its own reflection in a mirror it will perish instantly.
	But even a dead basilisk is dangerous, for it is said that
	merely touching its lifeless body can cause a person to

# includes "dart trap"
dart*
	Darts are missile weapons, designed to fly such that a sharp,
	often weighted point will strike first.  They can be
	distinguished from javelins by fletching (i.e., feathers on
	the tail) and a shaft that is shorter and/or more flexible,
	and from arrows by the fact that they are not of the right
	length to use with a normal bow.
		[ Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]

	Against my foe I hurled a murderous dart.
	He caught it in his hand -- I heard him laugh --
	I saw the thing that should have pierced his heart
	Turn to a golden staff.
		[ Gifts, by Mary Coleridge ]
demogorgon
	A terrible deity, whose very name was capable of producing the
	most horrible effects.  He is first mentioned by the 4th-century
	Christian writer, Lactantius, who in doing so broke with the
	superstition that the very reference to Demogorgon by name
	brought death and disaster.
		[ Brewer's Concise Dictionary of Phrase and Fable ]

	Demogorgon, the prince of demons, wallows in filth and can
	spread a quickly fatal illness to his victims while rending
	them.  He is a mighty spellcaster, and he can drain the life
	of mortals with a touch of his tail.

major demon
	It is often very hard to discover what any given Demon looks
	like, apart from a general impression of large size, huge
	fangs, staring eyes, many limbs, and an odd color; but all
	accounts agree that Demons are very powerful, very Magic (in
	a nonhuman manner), and made of some substance that can squeeze
	through a keyhole yet not be pierced with a Sword.  This makes
	them difficult to deal with, even on the rare occasions when
	they are friendly.

diamond
	The hardest known mineral (with a hardness of 10 on Mohs' scale).
	It is an allotropic form of pure carbon that has crystallized in
	the cubic system, usually as octahedra or cubes, under great
	pressure.
		[ A Concise Dictionary of Physics ]

	The diamond, _adamas_ or _dyamas_, is a transparent stone, like
	crystal, but having the colour of polished iron, but it cannot
	be destroyed by iron, fire or any other means, unless it is
	placed in the hot blood of a goat; with sharp pieces of diamond
	other stones are engraved and polished.  It is no greater than
	a small nut.  There are six kinds, however Adamant attracts
	metal; it expels venom; it produces amber (and is efficacious
	against empty fears and for those resisting spells).  It is
	found in India, in Greece and in Cyprus, where magicians make
	use of it.  It gives you courage; it averts apparitions; it
	removes anger and quarrels; it heals the mad; it defends you
	from your enemies.  It should be set in gold or silver and worn
	on the left arm.  It is likewise found in Arabia.
	 	[ The Aberdeen Bestiary, translated by Colin McLaren ]
dilithium*
	The most famous and the first to be named of the imaginary
	"minerals" of Star Trek is dilithium. ... Because of this
	mineral's central role in the storyline, a whole mythology
	surrounds it.  It is, however, a naturally occurring substance
	within the mythology, as there are various episodes that
	make reference to the mining of dilithium deposits. ...
	This name itself is imaginary and gives no real information on
	the structure or make-up of this substance other than that this
	version of the name implies a lithium and iron-bearing
	aluminosilicate of some sort.  That said, the real mineral that
	most closely matches the descriptive elements of this name is
	ferroholmquistite which is a dilithium triferrodiallosilicate.
	If one goes on the premise that nature follows certain general
	norms, then one could extrapolate that dilithium might have a
	similar number of silicon atoms in its structure.
	Keeping seven (i.e. hepto) ferrous irons and balancing the
	oxygens would give a theoretical formula of Li2Fe7Al2Si8O27.
	A mineral with this composition could theoretically exist,
	although it is doubtful that it would possess the more fantastic
	properties ascribed to dilithium.

	Ask not, what your magic can do to it.  Ask what it can do

dispater
	The Roman ruler of the underworld and fortune, similar to the
	Greek Hades.  Every hundred years, the Ludi Tarentini were
	celebrated in his honor.  The Gauls regarded Dis Pater as
	their ancestor.  The name is a contraction of the Latin Dives,
	"the wealthy", Dives Pater, "the wealthy father", or "Fater
	Wealth".  It refers to the wealth of precious stone below the
	earth.

djinn*
	The djinn are genies from the elemental plane of Air.  There,
	among their kind, they have their own societies.  They are
	sometimes encountered on earth and may even be summoned here
	to perform some service for powerful wizards.  The wizards
	often leave them about for later service, safely tucked away
	in a flask or lamp.  Once in a while, such a tool is found by

	when released that they might grant their rescuer a wish.

	In the West the dragon was the natural enemy of man.  Although
	preferring to live in bleak and desolate regions, whenever it
	was seen among men it left in its wake a trail of destruction
	and disease.  Yet any attempt to slay this beast was a perilous
	undertaking.  For the dragon's assailant had to contend
	not only with clouds of sulphurous fumes pouring from its fire
	breathing nostrils, but also with the thrashings of its tail,
	the most deadly part of its serpent-like body.
	  [ Mythical Beasts by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]

	"One whom the dragons will speak with," he said, "that is a
	dragonlord, or at least that is the center of the matter.  It's

	Dragons have no masters.  The question is always the same, with

dwarf*
	Dwarfs have faces like men (ugly men, with wrinkled, leathery
	skins), but are generally either flat-footed, duck-footed, or
	have feet pointing backwards.  They are of the earth, earthy,
	living in the darkest of caverns and venturing forth only
	with the cloaks by which they can make themselves invisible,
	and others disguised as toads.  Miners often come across them,
	and sometimes establish reasonably close relations with them.
	... The miners of Cornwall were always delighted to hear a
	bucca busily mining away, for all dwarfs have an infallible
	nose for precious metals.
	Among other things, dwarfs are rightly valued for their skill
	as blacksmiths and jewellers: they made Odin his famous spear
	Gungnir, and Thor his hammer; for Freya they designed a
	magnificent necklace, and for Frey a golden boar.  And in their
	spare time they are excellent bakers.  Ironically, despite
	their odd feet, they are particularly fond of dancing.  They
	can also see into the future, and consequently are excellent
	meteorologists.  They can be free with presents to people
	they like, and a dwarvish gift is likely to turn to gold in
	the hand.  But on the whole they are a snappish lot.

	In after days, when because of the triumph of Morgoth Elves and

	great lands and the isles, and took to the moonlight and the
	starlight, and to the woods and the caves, becoming as shadows
	and memories, save those who ever and anon set sail into the West
	and vanished from Middle-earth.  But in the dawn of years Elves
	and Men were allies and held themselves akin, and there were some
	among Men that learned the wisdom of the Eldar, and became great
	and valiant among the captains of the Noldor.  And in the glory
	and beauty of the Elves, and in their fate, full share had the

	One hot summer's day a Fox was strolling through an orchard

	took a run and a jump, and just missed the bunch. Turning

*fung*
	Fungi, division of simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true
	stems, roots, and leaves.  Unlike algae, fungi cannot
	photosynthesize, and live as parasites or saprophytes.  The
	division comprises the slime molds and true fungi.  True
	fungi are multicellular (with the exception of yeasts); the
	body of most true fungi consists of slender cottony
	filaments, or hyphae.  All fungi are capable of asexual
	reproduction by cell division, budding, fragmentation, or
	spores.  Those that reproduce sexually alternate a sexual
	generation (gametophyte) with a spore-producing one.  The
	four classes of true fungi are the algaelike fungi (e.g.,
	black bread mold and downy mildew), sac fungi (e.g., yeasts,
	powdery mildews, truffles, and blue and green molds such as
	Penicillium), basidium fungi (e.g., mushrooms and puffballs)
	and imperfect fungi (e.g., species that cause athlete's foot
	and ringworm).  Fungi help decompose organic matter (important
	in soil renewal); are valuable as a source of antibiotics,
	vitamins, and various chemicals; and for their role in
	fermentation, e.g., in bread and alcoholic beverage
	production.

*gargoyle
	And so it came to pass that while Man ruled on Earth, the
	gargoyles waited, lurking, hidden from the light.  Reborn
	every 600 years in Man's reckoning of time, the gargoyles
	joined battle against Man to gain dominion over the Earth.

	In each coming, the gargoyles were nearly destroyed by Men
	who flourished in greater numbers.  Now it has been so many
	hundreds of years that it seems the ancient statues and
	paintings of gargoyles are just products of Man's
	imagination.  In this year, with Man's thoughts turned toward
	the many ills he has brought among himself, Man has forgotten
	his most ancient adversary, the gargoyles.

	1 November - All day long we have travelled, and at a good

	thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the

	So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;
	The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws
	Reach'd to the armpits, and the back and breast,
	And either side, were painted o'er with nodes
	And orbits.  Colours variegated more
	Nor Turks nor Tartars e'er on cloth of state

	in search of prey, the armed instincts of nails and jaws which
	have for source and aim the belly, glare and smell out
	uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a
	shroud, erect in its vague and shuddering robe, and which seem
	to them to live with a dead and terrible life.  These
	brutalities, which are only matter, entertain a confused fear
	of having to deal with the immense obscurity condensed into an
	unknown being.  A black figure barring the way stops the wild
	beast short.  That which emerges from the cemetery intimidates
	and disconcerts that which emerges from the cave; the
	ferocious fear the sinister; wolves recoil when they encounter
	a ghoul.

	will answer if spoken to gently, he raised his hat, and asked
	of the gnome his name.  The gnome did not stop his hasty

	"But he hadn't made a full man, and it was animated by some sort

	runs, was only derived from the magic charm placed behind its
	teeth each day, that drew down to itself what was known as the
	`free sidereal strength of the universe.'
	"One evening, before evening prayers, the rabbi forgot to take
	the charm out of the Golem's mouth, and it fell into a frenzy.
	It raged through the dark streets, smashing everything in its
	path, until the rabbi caught up with it, removed the charm, and

hobgoblin
	Hobgoblin.  Used by the Puritans and in later times for

		Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,
		You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
		Are you not he?
	and obviously Puck would not wish to be called a hobgoblin
	if that was an ill-omened word.
	Hobgoblins are on the whole, good-humoured and ready to be
	helpful, but fond of practical joking, and like most of the
	fairies rather nasty people to annoy.  Boggarts hover on the
	verge of hobgoblindom.  Bogles are just over the edge.

	ninety-nine years and a day.  If anyone was so unwary as to

	are smallish creatures, but very agile.  They can put their
	victims to sleep with a venomous bite, but due to their size,
	the effect does not last long on humans.

	"Tothapis cut him off.  'Be still and hearken.  You will travel

		[ The Charwoman's Shadow, by Lord Dunsany ]

	An 'imp' is an off-shoot or cutting.  Thus an 'ymp tree' was
	a grafted tree, or one grown from a cutting, not from seed.
	'Imp' properly means a small devil, an off-shoot of Satan,
	but the distinction between goblins or bogles and imps from

	large amount of the shopkeep logic (hence the nature of the tribute)
	as well as a good part of the alignment system, the prayer code and
	the rewrite of "hell" in the 3.1 release.  Izchak was a professor
	of Philosophy, who taught at many respected institutions, including
	MIT and Stanford, and who also worked, for a period of time, at
	Xerox PARC.  Izchak was the first "librarian" of the NetHack project,
	and was a founding member of the DevTeam, joining in 1986 while he
	was working at the University of Pennsylvania (hence our former

	From the legend that he does not kill his own food has arisen

kabuto
	The kabuto is the helmet worn by the samurai.  It was
	characterized by a prominent beaked front which jutted out over
	the brow to protect the wearer's face; a feature that gives
	rise to their modern Japanese name of 'shokaku tsuki kabuto'
	(battering-ram helmet).  Their main constructional element
	was an oval plate, the shokaku bo, slightly domed for the
	head with a narrow prolongation in front that curved forwards
	and downwards where it developed a pronounced central
	fold.  Two horizontal strips encircling the head were riveted
	to this frontal strip:  the lower one, the koshimaki (hip
	wrap), formed the lower edge of the helmet bowl; the other,
	the do maki (body wrap), was set at about the level of the
	temples.  Filling the gaps between these strips and the shokaku
	bo were small plates, sometimes triangular but more commonly
	rectangular in shape.  Because the front projected so
	far from the head, the triangular gap beneath was filled by
	a small plate, the shoshaku tei ita, whose rear edge bent
	downwards into a flange that rested against the forehead.

	The Kops are a brilliant concept.  To take a gaggle of inept

	Even people who have never had anything to do with cops hate
	them.  Of course, we count on them to keep order and to protect
	us when we need protecting, and we love them on television shows
	in which they have nerves of steel and hearts of gold, but in
	the abstract, as a nation, collectively we hate them.  They are
	too much like high school principals.  We're very happy to see
	their pants fall down, and they look good to us with pie on
	their faces.  The Keystone Kops turn up--and they get punished
	for it, as they crash into each other, fall down, and suffer
	indignity after indignity.  Here is pure movie satisfaction.

	The Kops are very skillfully presented.  The comic originality
	and timing in one of their chase scenes requires imagination
	to think up, talent to execute, understanding of the medium,
	and, of course, raw courage to perform.  The Kops are madmen
	presented as incompetents, and they're madmen rushing around
	in modern machines.  What's more, the machines they were operating
	in their routines were newly invented and not yet experienced
	by the average moviegoer.  (In the early days of automobiles,
	it was reported that there were only two cars registered in all
	of Kansas City, and they ran into each other.  There is both

	The room was silent as she scrabbled in her box of pieces and,
	from the very bottom, produced a couple that she set down on
	the board with two decisive clicks.  The rest of the players,
	as one God, craned forward to peer at them.

	"A wenegade wiffard and fome fort of clerk," said Offler the
	Crocodile God, hindered as usual by his tusks.  "Well,

	cubes rattling about inside.  And then she sent them bouncing
	across the table.

lava
* lava
	You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you
	is an active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava
	come surging out, cascading back down into the depths.  The
	glowing rock fills the farthest reaches of the cavern with a
	blood-red glare, giving everything an eerie, macabre appearance.
	The air is filled with flickering sparks of ash and a heavy
	smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to the touch, and the
	thundering of the volcano drowns out all other sounds.
	Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
	formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the
	murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one
	side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured
	rock which seems to have been crafted by the devil himself.
	An immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the
	volcano, burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a
	bottomless pit far off to your left.  To the right, an immense
	geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously from a barren
	island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
	ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence
	of its own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the
	already hellish scene.  A dark, forboding passage exits to the
	south.

lembas*
	In the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender
	goods, Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and
	brought them many gifts of food and clothing for their
	journey.  The food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes,
	made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside,
	and inside was the colour of cream.  Gimli took up one of the
	cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye.
	'Cram,' he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp
	corner and nibbled at it.  His expression quickly changed,
	and he ate all the rest of the cake with relish.
	'No more, no more!' cried the Elves laughing.  'You have
	eaten enough already for a long day's march.'
	'I thought it was only a kind of cram, such as the Dalemen
	make for journeys in the wild,' said the Dwarf.
	'So it is,' they answered.  'But we call it lembas or
	waybread, and it is more strengthening than any foods made by
	Men, and it is more pleasant than cram, by all accounts.'

	The Larvae (Lemures) are Roman spirits of deceased family

	May 9, 11, and 13; this was called the "Feast of the Lemures".

	The Irish Leprechaun is the Faeries' shoemaker and is known
	under various names in different parts of Ireland:
	Cluricaune in Cork, Lurican in Kerry, Lurikeen in Kildare
	and Lurigadaun in Tipperary.  Although he works for the
	Faeries, the Leprechaun is not of the same species.  He is
	small, has dark skin and wears strange clothes.  His nature
	has something of the manic-depressive about it:  first he
	is quite happy, whistling merrily as he nails a sole on to a
	shoe; a few minutes later, he is sullen and morose, drunk
	on his home-made heather ale.  The Leprechaun's two great
	loves are tobacco and whiskey, and he is a first-rate con-man,
	impossible to out-fox.  No one, no matter how clever, has ever
	managed to cheat him out of his hidden pot of gold or his
	magic shilling.  At the last minute he always thinks of some
	way to divert his captor's attention and vanishes in the
	twinkling of an eye.

	But on its heels ere the sunset faded, there came a second
	apparition, striding with incredible strides and halting when
	it loomed almost upon me in the red twilight-the monstrous mummy
	of some ancient king still crowned with untarnished gold but
	turning to my gaze a visage that more than time or the worm had
	wasted. Broken swathings flapped about the skeleton legs, and
	above the crown that was set with sapphires and orange rubies, a
	black something swayed and nodded horribly; but, for an instant,
	I did not dream what it was.  Then, in its middle, two oblique
	and scarlet eyes opened and glowed like hellish coals, and two
	ophidian fangs glittered in an ape-like mouth.  A squat, furless,
	shapeless head on a neck of disproportionate extent leaned
	unspeakably down and whispered in the mummy's ear. Then, with
	one stride, the titanic lich took half the distance between us,
	and from out the folds of the tattered sere-cloth a gaunt arm
	arose, and fleshless, taloned fingers laden with glowering gems,
	reached out and fumbled for my throat . . .

	said were-wolf in all places where they could find it, and to
	take, burn, and kill it, without incurring any fine or other

	the contest because, of all the treasures created, it alone had
	the power to protect them from the giants.  As the legends
	surrounding Mjollnir grew, it began to take on the quality of
	"vigja", or consecration.  Thor used it to consecrate births,

master kaen
	One day, an army general invited the Buddhist monk I-Hsiu
	(literally, "One Rest") to his military head office for a
	dinner.  I-Hsiu was not accustomed to wearing luxurious
	clothings and so he just put on an old ordinary casual
	robe to go to the military base.  To him, "form is void".

	As he approached the base, two soldiers appeared before him
	and shouted, "Where does this beggar came from?  Identify
	yourself!  You do not have permission to be around here!"

	"My name is I-Hsiu Dharma Master.  I am invited by your
	general for a supper."

	The two soldiers examined the monk closely and said, "You
	liar.  How come my general invites such a shabby monk to
	dinner?  He invites the very solemn venerable I-Hsiu to our
	base for a great ceremony today, not you.  Now, get out!"

	I-Hsiu was unable to convince the soldiers that he was
	indeed the invited guest, so he returned to the temple
	and changed to a very formal solemn ceremonial robe for
	the dinner.  And as he returned to the military base, the
	soldiers observed that he was such a great Buddhist monk,
	let him in with honour.

	At the dinner, I-Hsiu sat in front of the table full of
	food but, instead of putting the food into his mouth, he
	picked up the food with his chopsticks and put it into
	his sleeves.  The general was curious, and whispered to
	him, "This is very embarrassing.  Do you want to take
	some food back to the temple?  I will order the cook to
	prepare some take out orders for you."  "No" replied the
	monk.  "When I came here, I was not allowed into the
	base by your soldiers until I wear this ceremonial robe.
	You do not invite me for a dinner.  You invite my robe.
	Therefore, my robe is eating the food, not me."

	"Listen, man-cub," said the Bear, and his voice rumbled like
	thunder on a hot night.  "I have taught thee all the Law of
	the Jungle for all the peoples of the jungle--except the
	Monkey-Folk who live in the trees.  They have no law.  They
	are outcasts.  They have no speech of their own, but use the
	stolen words which they overhear when they listen, and peep,
	and wait up above in the branches.  Their way is not our way.
	They are without leaders.  They have no remembrance.  They
	boast and chatter and pretend that they are a great people
	about to do great affairs in the jungle, but the falling of
	a nut turns their minds to laughter and all is forgotten.
	We of the jungle have no dealings with them.  We do not drink
	where the monkeys drink; we do not go where the monkeys go;
	we do not hunt where they hunt; we do not die where they die...."

morning star
	The morning star was a medieval weapon resembling a mace, but
	with a large spike on the end and smaller spikes around the
	circumference.  It was also known as the goedendag (from the
	Dutch word for "good day") and the holy water sprinkler (from
	its resemblance to the aspergillum sometimes used in the
	Catholic Mass).  It was used by both cavalry and infantry;
	the horseman's weapon typically had a shorter haft than the
	footman's, which might be up to six feet long.  It came into
	use in the beginning of the 14th century.
	The name "morning star" is often erroneously applied to the
	military flail (also known as the therscol), a similar weapon,
	but with the head attached by a short chain.

	startled Mrs. Hall.  It was the fact that all his forehead
	above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage, and
	that another covered his ears, leaving not a scrap of his
	face exposed excepting only his pink, peaked nose.  It was
	bright, pink, and shiny just as it had been at first.  He
	wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high, black, linen-
	lined collar turned up about his neck.  The thick black
	hair, escaping as it could below and between the cross

naginata
	A Japanese pole-arm, fitted with a curved single-edged blade.
	The blades ranged in length from two to four feet, mounted on
	shafts about four to five feet long.  The naginata were cut
	with a series of short grooves near to the tang, above which
	the back edge was thinned, but not sharpened, so that the
	greater part of the blade was a flattened diamond shape in
	section.  Seen in profile, the curve is slight or non-
	existent near the tang, becoming more pronounced towards the
	point.
	    []

	"With his naginata he killed five, but with the sixth it
	snapped asunder in the midst and, flinging it away, he drew
	his sword, wielding it in the zigzag style, the interlacing,
	cross, reversed dragonfly, waterwheel, and eight-sides-at-
	once styles of fencing and cutting down eight men; but as he
	brought down the ninth with a mighty blow on the helmet, the
	blade snapped at the hilt."

	A nunchaku is two sections of wood (or metal in modern

	one theory purports that it was developed from a horse's bit.
	Chinese nunchaku tend to be rounded, whereas Japanese are
	octagonal, and they were originally linked by horse hair.
	There are many variations on the nunchaku, ranging from the
	three sectional staff (san-setsu-kon nunchaku), to smaller

	Theseus felt her voice pulling him down into fathoms of

	and her musk was about him, her voice weaving the dream.  He
	knew then that she had been sent to tell him of something
	dreadful that was to happen to him later.  Her song was a
	warning.  But she had brought him a new kind of joy, one that

	that the road to nymphs is beset by monsters.

obsidian*
	A volcanic glass, homogeneous in texture and having a low water
	content, with a vitreous luster and a conchoidal fracture.  The
	color is commonly black, but may be some shade of red or brown,
	and cut sections sometimes appear to be green.  Like other
	volcanic glasses, obsidian is a lava that has cooled too quickly
	for the contained minerals to crystallize.  In chemical
	composition it is rich in silica and similar to granite.  It is
	favored by primitive peoples for knives, arrowheads, spearheads,
	and other weapons and tools.

odin
	Also called Sigtyr (god of Victory), Val-father (father of
	the slain), One-Eyed, Hanga-god (god of the hanged), Farma-
	god (god of cargoes), Hapta-god (god of prisoners), and
	Othin.  He is the prime god of the Norsemen:  god of war and
	victory, wisdom and prophecy, poetry, the dead, air and wind,
	hospitality, and magic.
	As the god of war and victory, Odin is ruler of the Valkyries,
	warrior-maidens who lived in the halls of Valhalla in Asgard,
	the hall of dead heroes where he held his court.
	These chosen ones will defend the realm of the gods against
	the Frost Giants on the final day of reckoning, Ragnarok.
	As god of the wind, Odin rides through the air on his eight-
	footed horse, Sleipnir, wielding Gungner, his spear, normally
	accompanied by his ravens, Hugin and Munin, who he would also
	use as his spies.
	As a god of hospitality, he enjoys visiting the earth in
	disguise to see how people were behaving and to see how they
	would treat him, not knowing who he was.
	Odin is usually represented as a one-eyed wise old man with a
	long white beard and a wide-brimmed hat (he gave one of his
	eyes to Mimir, the guardian of the well of wisdom in Hel, in
	exchange for a draught of knowledge).
ogre*
	Anyone who has met a gluttonous, nude, angry ogre, will not
	easily forget this encounter -- if he survives it at all.
	Both male and female ogres can easily grow as tall as three
	metres.  Build and facial expressions would remind one of a
	Neanderthal.  Its small, pointy, keen teeth are striking.
	Since ogres avoid direct sunlight, their ragged, unfurry
	skin is as white as a sheet.  They enjoy coating their body
	with lard and usually wear nothing but a loin-cloth.  An elf
	would smell its rancid stench at ten metres distance.
	Ogres are solitary creatures:  very rarely one may encounter
	a female with two or three young.  They are the only real
	carnivores among the humanoids, and its favourite meal is --
	not surprisingly -- human flesh.  They sometimes ally with
	orcs or goblins, but only when they anticipate a good meaty
	meal.

	He dwelt as a hunter with Diana (Artemis), with whom he

	but to no purpose. One day, observing Orion wading through
	the sea with his head just above the water, Apollo pointed
	it out to his sister and maintained that she could not hit
	that black thing on the sea. The archer-goddess discharged
	a shaft with fatal aim. The waves rolled the dead body of
	Orion to the land, and bewailing her fatal error with many

	Many of the weapons of the Middle Ages were poled or long-shafted
	arms.  Unlike the ancient spear or javelin, however, they were not
	intended to be thrown.  Some were devices with simple single- or
	double-edged blades and nothing more, while others combined
	the pick, spear, and hammer or axe all in one weapon.

polymorph trap
	One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams,
	he discovered that in bed he had been changed into a monstrous
	verminous bug.  He lay on his armour-hard back and saw, as he
	lifted his head up a little, his brown, arched abdomen divided
	up into rigid bow-like sections.  From this height the blanket,
	just about ready to slide off completely, could hardly stay in
	place.  His numerous legs, pitifully thin in comparison to the
	rest of his circumference, flickered helplessly before his eyes.

trident
poseido*n
	Poseido(o)n, lord of the seas and father of rivers and
	fountains, was the son of Chronos and Rhea, brother of Zeus,
	Hades, Hera, Hestia and Demeter.  His rank of ruler of the
	waves he received by lot at the Council Meeting of the Gods,
	at which Zeus took the upper world for himself and gave
	dominion over the lower world to Hades.
	Poseidon is associated in many ways with horses and thus is
	the god of horses.  He taught men how to ride and manage the
	animal he invented and is looked upon as the originator and
	guardian deity of horse races.
	His symbol is the familiar trident or three-pronged spear
	with which he can split rocks, cause or quell storms, and
	shake the earth, a power which makes him the god of
	earthquakes as well.  Physically, he is shown as a strong and
	powerful ruler, every inch a king.

	POTABLE, n.  Suitable for drinking.  Water is said to be

	from the recurrent disorder known as thirst, for which it
	is a medicine.  Upon nothing has so great and diligent
	ingenuity been brought to bear in all ages and in all
	countries, except the most uncivilized, as upon the
	invention of substitutes for water.  To hold that this

	location itself alters the position of the particle
	in an unpredictable way.  To locate the position accurately,
	photons of short wavelength would have to be used.  The high
	momentum of such photons would cause a large effect on the
	position.  On the other hand, using photons of lower momenta
	would have less effect on the particle's position, but would
	be less accurate because of the lower wavelength.

	watercourse.  Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and
	it did not take him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one
	that fitted his hand cosily.  As a boy he used to practise

	A sub-species of the spider (_Scorpionidae_), the scorpion

scorpius
	Since early times, the Scorpion has represented death, darkness,
	and evil.  Scorpius is the reputed slayer of Orion the Hunter.
	[...]  The gods put both scorpion and hunter among the stars, but

	As Scorpius rises in the east, Orion sets in the west.

set
seth
	The ancient Egyptian god of chaos (Set), the embodiment of
	hostility and even of outright evil.  He is also a god of war,
	deserts, storms, and foreign lands. ... In the Book of the
	Dead, Seth is called "Lord of the Northern Sky" and is held
	responsible for storms and cloudy weather. ... Seth was
	portrayed as a man with the head of undeterminable origin,
	although some see in it the head of an aardvark.  He had a
	curved snout, erect square-tipped ears and a long forked tail.
	He was sometimes entirely in animal form with the body similar
	to that of a greyhound.  Animals sacred to this god were the
	dog, the jackal, the gazelle, the donkey, the crocodile, the
	hippopotamus, and the pig.

shark
	As the shark moved, its dark top reflected virtually no

	movements as the shark rose, driven by the power of the
	great tail sweeping from side to side, like a scythe.
	The fish exploded upward.
	Charles Bruder felt a slight vacuum tug in the motion of
	the sea, noted it as a passing current, the pull of a wave,
	the tickle of undertow.  He could not have heard the faint
	sucking rush of water not far beneath him.  He couldn't
	have seen or heard what was hurtling from the murk at
	astonishing speed, jaws unhinging, widening, for the
	enormous first bite.  It was the classic attack
	that no other creature in nature could make -- a bomb from
	the depths.

shopkeeper
	There have been three general theories put forward to explain
	the phenomenon of the wandering shops or, as they are
	generically known, _tabernae vagantes._
	The first postulates that many thousands of years ago there
	evolved somewhere in the multiverse a race whose single talent
	was to buy cheap and sell dear.  Soon they controlled a vast
	galactic empire or, as they put it, Emporium, and the more
	advanced members of the species found a way to equip their very
	shops with unique propulsion units that could break the dark
	walls of space itself and open up vast new markets.  And long
	after the worlds of the Emporium perished in the heat death of
	their particular universe, after one last defiant fire sale,
	the wandering starshops still ply their trade, eating their way
	through the pages of spacetime like a worm through a three-
	volume novel.
	The second is that they are the creation of a sympathetic Fate,
	charged with the role of supplying exactly the right thing
	at the right time.
	The third is that they are simply a very clever way of getting
	around the various Sunday Closing acts.
	All these theories, diverse as they are, have two things in
	common.  They explain the observed facts, and they are
	completely and utterly wrong.

	"That dog belonged to a settler who tried to build his cabin
	on the bank of the river a few miles south of the fort,"
	grunted Conan. ...  "We took him to the fort and dressed his

	killed your master?" ...  "Let him come," muttered Conan.
	"He can smell the devils before we can see them." ...
	Slasher cleared the timbers with a bound and leaped into the
	bushes.  They were violently shaken and then the dog slunk
	back to Balthus' side, his jaws crimson. ...  "He was a man,"
	said Conan.  "I drink to his shade, and to the shade of the
	dog, who knew no fear."  He quaffed part of the wine, then
	emptied the rest upon the floor, with a curious heathen
	gesture, and smashed the goblet.  "The heads of ten Picts

	and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that
	the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face

	And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of
	the trees of the garden:  but of the fruit of the tree which is
	in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of
	it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.  And the serpent
	said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:  for God doth

	opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.  And
	when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
	was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one

sokoban
	Sokoban (Japanese for "warehouse keeper") is a transport puzzle
	in which the player pushes boxes around a maze, viewed from
	above, and tries to put them in designated locations.  Only one
	box may be pushed at a time, not two, and boxes cannot be pulled.
	As the puzzle would be extremely difficult to create physically,
	it is usually implemented as a video game.

	Sokoban was created in 1982 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and was
	published by Thinking Rabbit, a software house based in
	Takarazuka, Japan.  Thinking Rabbit also released three sequels:
	Boxxle, Sokoban Perfect and Sokoban Revenge.

	had been stung by hornets.  He jumped back, stumbled against

	or seemed likely to fall from off the bridge.  Now and then
	they stopped to rest, and each thought that he never had seen
	in all his life before such a hand at quarterstaff.  At last
	Robin gave the stranger a blow upon the ribs that made his
	jacket smoke like a damp straw thatch in the sun.  So shrewd
	was the stroke that the stranger came within a hair's breadth
	of falling off the bridge; but he regained himself right
	quickly, and, by a dexterous blow, gave Robin a crack on the
	crown that caused the blood to flow.  Then Robin grew mad
	with anger, and smote with all his might at the other; but
	the stranger warded the blow, and once again thwacked Robin,

	the way the lion was standing that it couldn't have been
	looking at him at all.  ("But supposing it turns its head?"

	namely a little dwarf who stood with his back to it about
	four feet away.  "Aha!" thought Edmund.  "When it springs at
	the dwarf then will be my chance to escape."  But still the
	lion never moved, nor did the dwarf.  And now at last Edmund
	remembered what the others had said about the White Witch

* tourist
	The road from Ankh-Morpork to Chrim is high, white and
	winding, a thirty-league stretch of potholes and half-buried
	rocks that spirals around mountains and dips into cool green
	valleys of citrus trees, crosses liana-webbed gorges on
	creaking rope bridges and is generally more picturesque than
	useful.
	Picturesque.  That was a new word to Rincewind the wizard
	(BMgc, Unseen University [failed]).  It was one of a number
	he had picked up since leaving the charred ruins of
	Ankh-Morpork.  Quaint was another one.  Picturesque meant --
	he decided after careful observation of the scenery that
	inspired Twoflower to use the word -- that the landscape was
	horribly precipitous.  Quaint, when used to describe the
	occasional village through which they passed, meant fever-
	ridden and tumbledown.
	Twoflower was a tourist, the first ever seen on the discworld.
	Tourist, Rincewind had decided, meant "idiot".

	The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say
	on the subject of towels.
	A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing
	an interstellar hitchhiker can have.  Partly it has great
	practical value.  You can wrap it around you for warmth as
	you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie
	on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus
	V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it
	beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world
	of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy
	River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it
	round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze
	of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-bogglingly
	stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't
	see you - daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can
	wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of
	course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean
	enough.

	I knew my Erik too well to feel at all comfortable on jumping
	into his house.  I knew what he had made of a certain palace at
	Mazenderan.  From being the most honest building conceivable, he

	not utter a word but it was overheard or repeated by an echo.
	With his trap-doors the monster was responsible for endless
	tragedies of all kinds.

trapper or lurker above
	The trapper is a creature which has evolved a chameleon-like
	ability to blend into the dungeon surroundings.  It captures
	its prey by remaining very still and blending into the
	surrounding dungeon features, until an unsuspecting creature
	passes by.  It wraps itself around its prey and digests it.

	A tree that may in Summer wear

tripe
tripe ration
	If you start from scratch, cooking tripe is a long-drawn-out
	affair.  Fresh whole tripe calls for a minimum of 12 hours of
	cooking, some time-honored recipes demanding as much as 24.
	To prepare fresh tripe, trim if necessary.  Wash it thoroughly,
	soaking overnight, and blanch, for 1/2 hour in salted water.
	Wash well again, drain and cut for cooking.  When cooked, the
	texture of tripe should be like that of soft gristle.  More
	often, alas, because the heat has not been kept low enough,
	it has the consistency of wet shoe leather.

~water troll
*troll
	The troll shambled closer.  He was perhaps eight feet tall,
	perhaps more.  His forward stoop, with arms dangling past
	thick claw-footed legs to the ground, made it hard to tell.
	The hairless green skin moved upon his body.  His head was a
	gash of a mouth, a yard-long nose, and two eyes which drank
	the feeble torchlight and never gave back a gleam.
	[...]
	Like a huge green spider, the troll's severed hand ran on its
	fingers.  Across the mounded floor, up onto a log with one
	taloned forefinger to hook it over the bark, down again it
	scrambled, until it found the cut wrist.  And there it grew
	fast.  The troll's smashed head seethed and knit together.
	He clambered back on his feet and grinned at them.  The
	waning faggot cast red light over his fangs.

	The tsurugi, also known as the long samurai sword, is an

	"My dear chap, right on time!  We'll just have lunch, and
	then I'm sure you've got a wonderful programme lined up for
	this afternoon!"
	"Er --"
	"That's great!"
	Rincewind took a deep breath.  "Look," he said desperately,
	"let's eat somewhere else.  There's been a bit of a fight
	down below."
	"A tavern brawl?  Why didn't you wake me up?"
	"Well, you see, I - _what_?"
	"I thought I made myself clear this morning, Rincewind.  I
	want to see genuine Morporkian life - the slave market, the
	Whore Pits, the Temple of Small Gods, the Beggar's Guild...
	and a genuine tavern brawl."  A faint note of suspicion
	entered Twoflower's voice.  "You _do_ have them, don't you?

	Weasel are always getting involved in.  You know --

tyr
	Yet remains that one of the Aesir who is called Tyr:
	he is most daring, and best in stoutness of heart, and he
	has much authority over victory in battle; it is good for
	men of valor to invoke him.  It is a proverb, that he is
	Tyr-valiant, who surpasses other men and does not waver.
	He is wise, so that it is also said, that he that is wisest
	is Tyr-prudent.  This is one token of his daring:  when the
	Aesir enticed Fenris-Wolf to take upon him the fetter Gleipnir,
	the wolf did not believe them, that they would loose him,
	until they laid Tyr's hand into his mouth as a pledge.  But
	when the Aesir would not loose him, then he bit off the hand
	at the place now called 'the wolf's joint;' and Tyr is one-
	handed, and is not called a reconciler of men.

	Umber hulks are powerful subterranean predators whose

	legs all end in great claws.
*unicorn
unicorn horn
	Men have always sought the elusive unicorn, for the single
	twisted horn which projected from its forehead was thought to
	be a powerful talisman.  It was said that the unicorn had
	simply to dip the tip of its horn in a muddy pool for the water
	to become pure.  Men also believed that to drink from this horn
	was a protection against all sickness, and that if the horn was
	ground to a powder it would act as an antidote to all poisons.
	Less than 200 years ago in France, the horn of a unicorn was
	used in a ceremony to test the royal food for poison.

	Although only the size of a small horse, the unicorn is a very
	fierce beast, capable of killing an elephant with a single
	thrust from its horn.  Its fleetness of foot also makes this
	solitary creature difficult to capture.  However, it can be
	tamed and captured by a maiden.  Made gentle by the sight of a
	virgin, the unicorn can be lured to lay its head in her lap, and
	in this docile mood, the maiden may secure it with a golden rope.

	Martin took a small sip of beer.  "Almost ready," he said.

~vampire bat

	He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship
	arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as

	friend John saw him fly from this so near house, and as my
	friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy. He can come
	in mist which he create--that noble ship's captain proved him
	of this; but, from what we know, the distance he can make this
	mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He come on
	moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those
	sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we
	ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a
	hairbreadth space at the tomb door.
		[ Dracula, by Bram Stoker ]

	The Oxford English Dictionary is quite unequivocal:
	_vampire_ - "a preternatural being of a malignant nature (in

	corpse), supposed to seek nourishment, or do harm, by sucking
	the blood of sleeping persons. ..."

venus
	Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, was the daughter of
	Jupiter and Dione.  Others say that Venus sprang from the
	foam of the sea.  The zephyr wafted her along the waves to
	the Isle of Cyprus, where she was received and attired by
	the Seasons, and then led to the assembly of the gods.  All
	were charmed with her beauty, and each one demanded her
	for his wife.  Jupiter gave her to Vulcan, in gratitude for
	the service he had rendered in forging thunderbolts.  So
	the most beautiful of the goddesses became the wife of the
	most ill-favoured of gods.

vlad*
	Vlad Dracula the Impaler was a 15th-Century monarch of the
	Birgau region of the Carpathian Mountains, in what is now
	Romania.  In Romanian history he is best known for two things.
	One was his skilled handling of the Ottoman Turks, which kept
	them from making further inroads into Christian Europe.  The
	other was the ruthless manner in which he ran his fiefdom.
	He dealt with perceived challengers to his rule by impaling
	them upright on wooden stakes.  Visiting dignitaries who
	failed to doff their hats had them nailed to their head.

	A wakizashi was used as a samurai's weapon when the katana
	was unavailable.  When entering a building, a samurai would
	leave his katana on a rack near the entrance.  However, the
	wakizashi would be worn at all times, and therefore, it made
	a sidearm for the samurai (similar to a soldier's use of a
	pistol).  The samurai would have worn it from the time they
	awoke to the time they went to sleep.  In earlier periods,
	and especially during times of civil wars, a tanto was worn
	in place of a wakizashi.

	80,000 monkeys, "This pond is possessed by a water demon.  Do
	not let anybody go into it."

	After a little while, the water demon saw that none of the
	monkeys went into the water to drink.  So he rose out of the
	middle of the pond, taking the shape of a frightening monster.
	He had a big blue belly, a white face with bulging green eyes,
	and red claws and feet.  He said, "Why are you just sitting
	around?  Come into the pond and drink at once!"

	The monkey king said to the horrible monster, "Are you the

	you eat whoever goes into the water?" asked the king.  "Yes,

	A distant cousin of the earth elemental, the xorn has the
	ability to shift the cells of its body around in such a way
	that it becomes porous to inert material.  This gives it the
	ability to pass through any obstacle that might be between it
	and its next meal.
ya
	The arrow of choice of the samurai, ya are made of very
	straight bamboo, and are tipped with hardened steel.
yeenoghu
	Yeenoghu, the demon lord of gnolls, still exists although
	all his followers have been wiped off the face of the earth.
	He casts magic projectiles at those close to him, and a mere
	gaze into his piercing eyes may hopelessly confuse the
	battle-weary adventurer.
yeti
	The Abominable Snowman, or yeti, is one of the truly great
	unknown animals of the twentieth century.  It is a large hairy
	biped that lives in the Himalayan region of Asia ... The story
	of the Abominable Snowman is filled with mysteries great and
	small, and one of the most difficult of all is how it got that
	awful name.  The creature is neither particularly abominable,
	nor does it necessarily live in the snows.  _Yeti_ is a Tibetan
	word which may apply either to a real, but unknown animal of
	the Himalayas, or to a mountain spirit or demon -- no one is
	quite sure which.  And after nearly half a century in which
	Westerners have trampled around looking for the yeti, and
	asking all sorts of questions, the original native traditions
	concerning the creature have become even more muddled and
	confused.

*yugake
	Japanese leather archery gloves.  Gloves made for use while
	practicing had thumbs reinforced with horn.  Those worn into
	battle had thumbs reinforced with a double layer of leather.
yumi
	The samurai is highly trained with a special type of bow,
	the yumi.  Like the ya, the yumi is made of bamboo.  With
	the yumi-ya, the bow and arrow, the samurai is an extremely
	accurate and deadly warrior.
*zombi*
	The zombi... is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but
	taken from the grave and endowed by sorcery with a
	mechanical semblance of life, -- it is a dead body which is
	made to walk and act and move as if it were alive.
		[ W. B. Seabrook ]
zruty
	The zruty are wild and gigantic beings, living in the
	wildernesses of the Tatra mountains.
