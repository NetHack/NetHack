%Cc Arc 00001
You are suddenly in familiar surroundings.  The buildings in the distance
seem to be those of your old alma mater, but something is wrong.  It feels
as if there has been a riot recently, or %H has
been under siege.

All of the windows are boarded up, and there are objects scattered around
the entrance.

Strange forbidding shapes seem to be moving in the distance.
%E [You arrive at %H, but all is not well.]
%Cp Arc 00002
Once again, you are back at %H.
%E
%Cp Arc 00003
You are back at %H.
You have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.
%E
%Cp Arc 00005
"Did you see Lash LaRue in 'Song of Old Wyoming' the other night?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00006
"Hey man, got any potions of hallucination for sale?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00007
"Did you see the artifact %l brought back from the last dig?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00008
"So what species do *you* think we evolved from?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00009
"So you're %ls prize pupil!  I don't know what he sees in you."
%E
%Cp Arc 00010
"Did you see Lash LaRue in 'Song of Old Wyoming' the other night?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00011
"Hey man, got any potions of hallucination for sale?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00012
"I guess you are guaranteed to make full professor now."
%E
%Cp Arc 00013
"So, what was worse, %n or your entrance exams?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00014
"%oC is impressive, but nothing like the bones I dug up!"
%E
%Cc Arc 00015
"Finally you have returned, %p.  You were always
my most promising student.  Allow me to see if you are ready for the
most difficult task of your career."
%E ["You have returned, %p, to a difficult task."]
%Cp Arc 00016
"Again, %p, you stand before me.
Let me see if you have gained experience in the interim."
%E
%Cp Arc 00017
"Once more, %p, you have returned from the field.
Are you finally ready for the task that must be accomplished?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00018
"%p, you have failed us.  All of my careful training has been in
vain.  Begone!  Your tenure at this college has been revoked!

"You are a disgrace to the profession!"
%E ["%pC, you have failed us.  Begone!"]
%Cc Arc 00019
"%p, you are yet too inexperienced to undertake such a demanding
quest.  A mere %r could not possibly face the rigors demanded and
survive.  Go forth, and come here again when your adventures have further
taught you."
%E [%pC, a mere %r is too inexperienced.]
%Cc Arc 00020
"%pC!  I've heard that you've been using sloppy techniques.  Your
results lately can hardly be called suitable for %ra!

"How could you have strayed from the %a path?  Go from here, and come
back only when you have purified yourself."
%E ["%pC, you have strayed from the %a path.  Purify yourself!"]
%Cc Arc 00021
"Grave times have befallen the college, for %na has
stolen %o.  Without it, the board of directors of
the university will soon have no choice but to revoke our research grants.

"You must locate the entrance to %i.  Within it,
you will find %n.

"You must then defeat %n and return %o
to me.

"Only in this way will we be able to prevent the budget cuts that could
close this college.

"May the wisdom of %d be your guide."
%E [%nC has stolen %o.  Locate %i, defeat %ni, and return %O.]
%Cp Arc 00025
"Beware, for %n is powerful and cunning."
%E
%Cp Arc 00026
"To locate the entrance to %i, you must pass
many traps."
%E
%Cp Arc 00027
"A %nt may be vulnerable to attacks by magical cold."
%E
%Cp Arc 00028
"Call upon %d when you encounter %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00029
"You must destroy %n.  It will pursue you otherwise."
%E
%Cp Arc 00030
"%oC is a mighty talisman.  With it you
can destroy %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00031
"Go forth with the blessings of %d."
%E
%Cp Arc 00032
"I will have my %gP watch for your return."
%E
%Cp Arc 00033
"Remember not to stray from the true %a path."
%E
%Cp Arc 00034
"You may be able to sense %o when you are near."
%E
%Cc Arc 00035
A plain opens before you.  Beyond the plain lies a foreboding edifice.

You have the feeling that you will soon find the entrance to
%i.
%E [This foreboding edifice must hide the entrance to %i.]
%Cp Arc 00036
Once again, you are near the entrance to %i.
%E
%Cc Arc 00040
A strange feeling washes over you, and you think back to things you
learned during the many lectures of %l.

You realize the feeling must be the presence of %o.
%E [This strange feeling must be the presence of %o.]
%Cp Arc 00041
The familiar presence of %o is in the ether.
%E
# delivered instead of 00041 if %o is not on the level anymore;
# hero might already be carrying it, so don't say anything like
# "%o's presence can't be felt"
%Cp Arc 00042
The have returned to %ns lair.
%E
%Cc Arc 00050
"So, %p, you think that you can succeed in recovering
%o, when your teacher, %l, has already failed.

"Come, try your best!  I shall destroy you, and gnaw on your bones."
%E ["Come, %p, I shall destroy you!"]
%Cc Arc 00051
"Again you try to best me, eh %p?  Well, you shall fail again.

"You shall never recover %o.

"I shall bear your soul to the Plane of Origins for my master's pleasure."
%E ["Again you try to best me, %p?  You shall never recover %o."]
%Cp Arc 00052
"You persist yet %p!  Good.  Now, you shall die!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00053
"I shall have %o from you, %p, then feast
upon your entrails!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00060
"Try your best, %p.  You cannot defeat me."
%E
%Cp Arc 00061
"I shall rend the flesh from your body whilst you still breathe!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00062
"First you, %p, then I shall destroy your mentor, %l."
%E
%Cp Arc 00063
"Tiring yet, %p?  I draw my power from my master and cannot
falter!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00064
"I shall rend thy soul from thy body and consume it!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00065
"You are far too %a -- it weakens you.  You shall die in this place."
%E
%Cp Arc 00066
"%d has forsaken you!  You are lost now!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00067
"A mere %r cannot hope to defeat me!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00068
"If you are the best %l can send, I have nothing to fear."
%E
%Cp Arc 00069
"Die %c!  I shall exhibit your carcass as a trophy."
%E
%Cc Arc 00070
The power of %o flows through your body!  You feel
as if you could now take on the Wizard of Yendor himself and win, but
you know you must return %o to %l.
%E [The power of %o flows through your body!  You must return it to %l.]
%Cp Arc 00080
The body of %n dissipates in a cloud of noxious fumes.
%E
%Cc Arc 00081
%lC touches %o briefly, gazes into it,
then smiles at you and says:

"Well done, %p.  You have defeated %n and
recovered %o.  But I fear that it shall never be safe
here.

Please take %o with you.  You, %p, can
guard it now far better than I.

May the blessings of %d follow you and guard you."
%E [%lC instructs you to guard %o from now on.]
# assumes Orb of Detection (glass object)
%Cc Arc 00082
"Careful, %p!  %oC might break, and that would be
a tragic loss.  You are its keeper now, and the time has come to
resume your search for the Amulet.  %Z await your
return through the magic portal that brought you here."
%E ["Resume your search for the Amulet beyond the magic portal to %Z."]
%Cc Arc 00090
"Welcome back, %p.  Have you progressed with your quest to
regain the Amulet of Yendor for %d?"
%E ["Have you progressed with your quest to regain the Amulet of Yendor for %d?"]
%Cc Arc 00091
"Congratulations, %p.  I wondered if anyone could prevail against
the Wizard and the minions of Moloch.  Now, you must embark on one
final adventure.

"Take the Amulet, and find your way onto the Astral Plane.
There you must find the altar of %d and sacrifice the
Amulet on that altar to fulfill your destiny.

"Remember, your path now should always be upwards."
%E [Take the Amulet to the Astral Plane and sacrifice it at the altar of %d.]

#
%Cc Bar 00001
Warily you scan your surroundings, all of your senses alert for signs
of possible danger.  Off in the distance, you can %x the familiar shapes
of %H.

But why, you think, should %l be there?

Suddenly, the hairs on your neck stand on end as you detect the aura of
evil magic in the air.

Without thought, you ready your weapon, and mutter under your breath:

    "By %d, there will be blood spilt today."
%E [You reach the vicinity of %H, but sense evil magic nearby.]
%Cp Bar 00002
Once again, you near %H.  You know that %l
will be waiting.
%E
%Cp Bar 00003
Again, and you think possibly for the last time, you approach
%H.
%E
%Cp Bar 00005
"The battles here have been good -- our enemies' blood soaks the soil!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00006
"Remember that glory is crushing your enemies beneath your feet!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00007
"There has been little treasure to loot, since the horde arrived."
%E
%Cp Bar 00008
"The horde is mighty in numbers, but they have little courage."
%E
%Cp Bar 00009
"%lC is a strange one, but he has helped defend us."
%E
%Cp Bar 00010
"The battles here have been good -- our enemies' blood soaks the soil!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00011
"Remember that glory is crushing your enemies beneath your feet!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00012
"Times will be good again, now that the horde is vanquished."
%E
%Cp Bar 00013
"You have brought our clan much honor in defeating %n."
%E
%Cp Bar 00014
"You will be a worthy successor to %l."
%E
%Cc Bar 00015
"Ah, %p.  You have returned at last.  The world is in dire
need of your help.  There is a great quest you must undertake.

"But first, I must see if you are ready to take on such a challenge."
%E ["At last you have returned.  There is a great quest you must undertake."]
%Cp Bar 00016
"%p, you are back.  Are you ready now for the challenge?"
%E
%Cp Bar 00017
"Again, you stand before me, %p.  Surely you have prepared yourself."
%E
%Cc Bar 00018
"Pah!  You have betrayed the gods, %p.  You will never attain
the glory which you aspire to.  Your failure to follow the true path has
closed this future to you.

"I will protect these people as best I can, but soon %n will overcome
me and destroy all who once called you %s.  Now begone!"
%E ["You have betrayed %d; soon %n will destroy us.  Begone!"]
%Cc Bar 00019
"%p, I fear that you are as yet too inexperienced to face
%n.  Only %Ra with the help of %d could ever hope to
defeat %ni."
%E ["You are too inexperienced.  Come back when you are %Ra."]
%Cc Bar 00020
"%pC!  You have wandered from the path of the %a!
If you attempt to overcome %n in this state, he will surely
enslave your soul.  Your only hope, and ours, lies in your purification.
Go forth, and return when you feel ready."
%E ["You have wandered from the path of the %a.  Come back when you have atoned."]
%Cc Bar 00021
"The world is in great need of your assistance, %p.

"About six months ago, I learned that a mysterious sorcerer, known
as %n, had begun to gather a large group of cutthroats and brigands
about %ni.

"At about the same time, these people you once rode with `liberated' a
potent magical talisman, %o, from a Turanian caravan.

"%nC and %nj Black Horde swept down upon %i and defeated
the people there, driving them out into the desert.  He has taken
%o, and seeks to bend it to %nj will.  I detected the
subtle changes in the currents of fate, and joined these people.
Then I sent forth a summons for you.

"If %n can bend %o to %nj will, he will become
almost indestructible.  He will then be able to enslave the minds of
men across the world.  You are the only hope.  The gods smile upon you,
and with %d behind you, you alone can defeat %n.

"You must go to %i.  From there, you can track down
%n, defeat %ni, and return %o to us.  Only
then will the world be safe."
%E ["Find %n, defeat %ni, and return %o to us."]
%Cp Bar 00025
"%nC is strong in the dark arts, but not immune to cold steel."
%E
%Cp Bar 00026
"Remember that %n is a great sorcerer.  He lived in the time
of Atlantis."
%E
%Cp Bar 00027
"If you fail, %p, I will not be able to protect these people long."
%E
%Cp Bar 00028
"To enter %i, you must be very stealthy.  The horde will be on
guard."
%E
%Cp Bar 00029
"Call upon %d in your time of need."
%E
%Cp Bar 00030
"May %d protect you, and guide your steps."
%E
%Cp Bar 00031
"If you can lay hands upon %o, carry it for good fortune."
%E
%Cp Bar 00032
"I cannot stand against %ns sorcery.  But %d will help you."
%E
%Cp Bar 00033
"Do not fear %n.  I know you can defeat %ni."
%E
%Cp Bar 00034
"You have a great road to travel, %p, but only after you defeat
%n."
%E
%Cc Bar 00035
The scent of water comes to you in the desert breeze.  You know that
you have located %i.
%E [You have located %i.]
%Cp Bar 00036
Yet again you have a chance to infiltrate %i.
%E
%Cc Bar 00040
The hairs on the nape of your neck lift as you sense an energy in the
very air around you.  You fight down a primordial panic that seeks to
make you turn and run.  This is surely the lair of %n.
%E [This is surely the lair of %n.]
%Cp Bar 00041
Yet again you feel the air around you heavy with malevolent magical energy.
%E
%Cc Bar 00050
"So.  This is what that second rate sorcerer %l sends to do %lj bidding.
I have slain many before you.  You shall give me little sport.

"Prepare to die, %c."
%E [%nC boasts that %nh has slain many.  "Prepare to die, %c."]
%Cp Bar 00051
"I have wasted too much time on you already.  Now, you shall die."
%E
%Cp Bar 00052
"You return yet again, %c!  Are you prepared for death now?"
%E
%Cp Bar 00053
"I shall have %o back, you pitiful excuse for %ca.
And your life as well."
%E
%Cp Bar 00060
"My pets will dine on your carcass tonight!"
%E
%Cp Bar 00061
"You are a sorry excuse for %ra."
%E
%Cp Bar 00062
"Run while you can, %c.  My next spell will be your last."
%E
%Cp Bar 00063
"I shall use your very skin to bind my next grimoire."
%E
%Cp Bar 00064
"%d cannot protect you now.  Here, you die."
%E
%Cp Bar 00065
"Your %a nature makes you weak.  You cannot defeat me."
%E
%Cp Bar 00066
"Come, %c.  I shall kill you, then unleash the horde on your tribe."
%E
%Cp Bar 00067
"Once you are dead, my horde shall finish off %l, and your tribe."
%E
%Cp Bar 00068
"Fight, %c, or are you afraid of the mighty %n?"
%E
%Cp Bar 00069
"You have failed, %c.  Now, my victory is complete."
%E
%Cc Bar 00070
As you pick up %o, you feel the power of it
flowing through your hands.  It seems to be in two or more places
at once, even though you are holding it.
%E [You feel the power of %o flowing through your hands.]
%Cc Bar 00080
%nC falls to the ground, and utters a last curse at you.  Then %nj
body fades slowly, seemingly dispersing into the air around you.  You
slowly become aware that the overpowering aura of magic in the air has
begun to fade.
%E [%nC curses you, but you feel the overpowering aura of magic fading.]
%Cc Bar 00081
When %l sees %o, he smiles, and says:

    Well done, %p.  You have saved the world from certain doom.
    What, now, should be done with %o?

    These people, brave as they are, cannot hope to guard it from
    other sorcerers who will detect it, as surely as %n did.

    Take %o with you, %p.  It will guard you in
    your adventures, and you can best guard it.  You embark on a
    quest far greater than you realize.

    Remember me, %p, and return when you have triumphed.  I
    will tell you then of what you must do.  You will understand when the
    time comes.
%E [%lC tells you to guard %o, and to return when you have triumphed.]
%Cc Bar 00082
%l gazes reverently at %o, then back at you.

"You are its keeper now, and the time has come to resume your search
for the Amulet.  %Z await your return through the
magic portal which brought you here."
%E ["You keep %o.  Return to %Z to search for the Amulet."]
%Cp Bar 00090
"Tell us, %p, have you fared well on your great quest?"
%E
%Cc Bar 00091
"This is wondrous, %p.  I feared that you could not possibly
succeed in your quest, but here you are in possession of the Amulet
of Yendor!

"I have studied the texts of the magi constantly since you left.  In
the Book of Skelos, I found this:

    %d will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to
    be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for %d has willed it so.
    It is said that the child of %d will recover the Amulet of Yendor
    that was stolen from the Creator at the beginning of time.

"As you now possess the amulet, %p, I suspect that the Book
speaks of you.

    The child of %d will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral
    Plane, where the Great Temple of %d is to be found.  The Amulet
    will be sacrificed to %d, there on %dJ altar.  Then the child will
    stand by %d as champion of all %cP for eternity.

"This is all I know, %p.  I hope it will help you."
%E ["Take the Amulet to the altar of %d on the Astral Plane and offer it."]

%Cc Cav 00001
You descend through a barely familiar stairwell that you remember
%l showing you when you embarked upon your vision quest.

You arrive back at %H, but something seems
wrong here.  The usual smoke and glowing light of the fires of the
outer caves are absent, and an uneasy quiet fills the damp air.
%E [You arrive back at %H, but something is wrong here.]
%Cp Cav 00002
Once again, you arrive back at %H.
%E
%Cp Cav 00003
For some reason, you think that this may be the last time you will
enter %H.
%E
%Cp Cav 00005
"We have not been able to gather as much food since the Giants sealed
off our access to the outer world."
%E
%Cp Cav 00006
"Since %n sent her minions, we have been constantly fighting."
%E
%Cp Cav 00007
"I have heard your vision quest was successful.  Is this so?"

%Cp Cav 00008
"So, tell me, %p, how have you fared?"

%Cp Cav 00009
"%lC grows old.  We know not who will guide us after he ascends."

"The rains have returned and the land grows lush again."

"Peace has returned, give thanks to %d!"

"So, %p, tell us the story of your fight with %n."

"%lC grows old.  Perhaps you will guide us after he ascends."
%E
%Cc Cav 00015
"You have returned from your vision quest, %p.  Thank %d.

"We are in dire need of your help, my %S.

"But first, I must see if you are yet capable of the quest I would
ask you to undertake."
%E ["You have returned.  We are in dire need of your help."]
%Cp Cav 00016
"Again, you return to us, %p.  Let me see if you are ready now."
%E
%Cp Cav 00017
"Ah, %p.  Are you finally ready?"
%E
%Cc Cav 00018
"%pC!  You have sealed our fate.  You seem unable to reform yourself,
so I must select another to take your place.

"Begone from %H!  You have betrayed us by choosing
the path of the %C over the true path of the %L.

"You no longer live in our eyes."
%E ["You have betrayed the %L.  Begone!"]
%Cc Cav 00019
"Alas, %p, you are as yet too inexperienced to embark upon such
a difficult quest as that I propose to give you.

"%rA could not possibly survive the rigors demanded to find
%i, never mind to confront %n herself.

"Adventure some more, and you will learn the skills you will require.
%d decrees it."
%E ["%rA is too inexperienced.  Come back when you have progressed."]
%Cc Cav 00020
"%pC!  You have deviated from my teachings.  You no longer follow
the path of the %a as you should.  I banish you from these caves, to
go forth and purify yourself.  Then, you might be able to accomplish this
quest."
%E ["You no longer follow the path of the %a.  Go, and purify yourself."]
%Cc Cav 00021
"You are indeed ready now, %p.  I shall tell you a tale of
great suffering among your people:

"Shortly after you left on your vision quest, the caves were invaded by
the creatures sent against us by %n.

"She, herself, could not attack us due to her great size, but her minions
have harassed us ever since.  In the first attacks, many died, and the
minions of %n managed to steal %o.
They took it to %i and there, none of our
%g warriors have been able to go.

"You must find %i, and within it wrest
%o from %n.  She guards it as
jealously as she guards all treasures she attains.  But with it,
we can make our caves safe once more.

"Please, %p, recover %o for us, and return it here."
%E [Find and defeat %n, recover %o, and return with it.]
%Cp Cav 00025
"%nC is immune to her own breath weapons.
You should use magic upon her that she does not use herself."

"There will be nowhere to hide inside %ns inner sanctum."

%Cp Cav 00028
"Your best chance with %n will be to keep moving."

"Do not be distracted by the great treasures in %ns lair.
Concentrate on %o."
%E
%Cp Cav 00030
"%oC is the only object that %n truly fears."
%E
%Cp Cav 00031
"Do not be fooled by %ns size.  She is fast, and it is
rumored that she uses magic."
%E
%Cp Cav 00032
"I would send a party of %gP with you, but we will need all
of our strength to defend ourselves."

%Cp Cav 00033
"Remember, be %a at all times.  This is your strength."
