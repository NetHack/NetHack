Git has a messy learning curve. This file is an attempt to serve as a quick
reference for basic tasks while you get up to speed.

------------------------

[*] git checkout [-f] (branch)

Switch your local repository to be at the most recent commit of (branch). 
Including -f will discard changes made in the working directory.


[*] git status [-uall | -uno]

Shows all changed files in your local repository and also a list of the ones
you have staged for commit.
Including -uall will also show you all untracked files in all subdirectories.
Including -uno will show you _no_ untracked files.


[*] git log [-NUM]
[*] git log <commit1> <commit2>
[*] git log [--pretty=one]
[*] git log (branch)

For a full explanation of all the arguments you can pass to 'log', please see
the manual; there are a lot and these are just a few of the common ones. For 
our purposes, git log will show you all the commits according to criteria 
you specify:

-NUM: The last NUM commits in this branch
<commit1> <commit2>: all commits between commit1 and commit2
-pretty=one: format output as a single line for each entry
(branch): show the commits from (branch) instead of the current one

[*] git log --pretty=one --decorate --graph --all

(This is best explained by executing and looking at the output.)


[*] git add (filename)
[*] git nhadd (filename)

Adds the changes you've made in (filename) to the pre-commit staging area.
(also referred to as the 'index')
 OR
Make a new file be tracked by git.

"nhadd" is the preferred syntax and will automatically update the source file
headers with the latest date, branch, and version.  See Developer.txt for
details.


[*] git commit [-a] [-m "text"]
[*] git nhcommit [-a] [-m "text"]

Commits all staged changes (in the index) to this branch in your local repo
from your current position.
Including -a will 'git add' all eligible files before doing so.
Including -m will use "text" as the commit message instead of opening an
editor window for you to create one.

"nhcommit" is the preferred syntax and will automatically update the source file
headers with the latest date, branch, and version.  See Developer.txt for
details.


[*] git push [--all] [-u origin (branch)]

Sends all your commits for the current branch to the centralized repo.
Including --all will send the commits for _all_ branches.
Specifying -u is only needed the first time you push (branch) that you
created; it establishes the connection between local and remote for that
branch.


[*] git reset [--hard] (filename)

Without any parameters, unstages the changes for (filename) from the index;
does not change the working tree. This is the equivalent of the command 
git reset --mixed (filename); git reset --soft (filename) has no effect.

With --hard, unstages (filename) from the index and reverts (filename) in
the working tree to the most recent commit.

*** WARNING *** --hard _will_ throw away your changes.


[DSR: I'm hesitant about including this command because you can trash stuff
with it. But at the same time, for people who are adapting to a commit not
also automatically being a send, it's nice for them to know how to undo one in
case they do something wrong. thoughts?]

[*] git reset [--soft | --mixed | --hard] HEAD~1

*** WARNING *** Never, EVER do this to a commit that you have already pushed;
you will be rewriting history on other people's machines and this will
generally turn out very poorly.

With --soft, undoes the most recent 'git commit' action, but leaves the 
changes in the index and in the working directory.

With --mixed, does everything --soft does but also unstages the changes from
the index. If you don't specify one of the three, reset will assume this.

With --hard, does everything --mixed does but also reverts the working tree to
the prior commit. 

*** WARNING *** --hard will effectively delete a commit and "lose" the changes.
[/end area-of-concern]


[*] git fetch [--all]

Retrieve commits from the remote repository to your machine.
Including --all will get commits for all branches.
Does NOT merge them into your local repository.


[*] git pull

Incorporate any fetched commits for the current branch into your repository
and update your position accordingly. This will create a merge commit (noting
that you merged a branch into itself).


[*] git rebase [no-arguments version ONLY]

Incorporate fetched commits for the current branch into your repository, and
replay any local commits and changes afterwards on top.

Quality picture-pages ASCII art:

                                  E---F---G---H (remote changes)
                                 /
                                /
(branch 'frog')    A---B---C---D---E'---F' (your local changes)

After 'git fetch' and 'git rebase', it will look like this:

                                               --- (remote HEAD)
                                               |
                                               V
(branch 'frog')    A---B---C---D---E---F---G---H---E'---F'
                                                   ^    ^
                                                   |    |
                                                   -------- (to be pushed)


[*] git branch (branch)

Creates a new branch from the current commit you're pointed to.
Does not automatically checkout (switch to) the branch.


[*] git checkout -b (branch)

Creates a new branch from the current commit you're pointed to, and
automatically checks out that branch.


[*] git branch <pattern> --list | [--all | -a] | [--remotes | -r]

Lists all branches matching <pattern>.
With --all instead, lists all branches (including remotely tracked ones).
With --remotes instead, lists only remote branches.


[*] git merge (branch) [--no-commit]

Merges all the changes from (branch) since it last diverged from a common
ancestor into your current branch.

With --no-commit, does not automatically create a merge entry in the log but
leaves all the merged files in your working directory; to complete the merge
you must commit them manually later (likely after you have edited them). This
more accurately mimics the merge behavior of svn [and cvs?]


[*] git stash [save | apply | list] <stashname>

save: Takes all changes in your working directory and 'stashes' them in a temporary
holding area. Convenient if the command you're trying to run won't go unless
you have a clean working dir; also convenient to move experimental changes
between branches without needing to commit them.

apply: Replays the named stash onto your current working directory as though
it were a patch. Does not delete the stash from the list.

list: Lists all of your stashed code blobs.
