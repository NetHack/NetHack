Introduction

This file documents the support for various sound library integration
interface, or just soundlib for short.

The soundlib support is through a standard interface, separating the
main NetHack code from soundlib-specific code.  The implementation
supports multiple soundlib systems in the same binary.  Even if you only
wish to support one soundlib, you will need to follow the instructions
to end up with a compiled binary

I.  Sound Trigger Types and Terminology

There are 4 distinct types of sound sound_triggers used by NetHack.

    SOUND_TRIGGER_USERSOUNDS      User-specified sounds that play based
                                  on config file entries that identify a
                                  regular expression to match against
                                  message window text, and identify an
                                  external sound file to load in response.
                                  The sound interface function pointer
                                  used to invoke it:

                                  void (*sound_play_usersound)(char *filename,
                                               int32_t volume, int32_t idx);

    SOUND_TRIGGER_HEROMUSIC      Invoked by the core when the in-game hero,
                                 or perhaps another creature, is playing
                                 a tune on an instrument. The sound interface
                                 function pointer used to invoke it:

                                 void (*sound_hero_playnotes)
                                       (int32_t instrument, const char *str,
                                        int32_t volume);

    SOUND_TRIGGER_ACHIEVEMENTS   Invoked by the core when an in-game
                                 achievement is reached. The soundlib routines
                                 could play appropriate theme or some fanfare
                                 in response.
                                 There needs to be a way to map each
                                 achievement to a specific external
                                 sound file or resource. The sound
                                 interface function pointer used to
                                 invoke it:

                                 void (*sound_achievement)(schar, schar,
                                                            int32_t);

    SOUND_TRIGGER_SOUNDEFFECTS   Invoked by the core when something
                                 sound-producing happens in the game. The
                                 soundlib routines could play an appropriate
                                 sound effect in response. They can be
                                 public-domain or suitably licensed stock
                                 sounds included with the
                                 gamesource. The soundeffect must be made
                                 available during the build process, or
                                 (not-yet-implemented) a way to tie a
                                 particular sound effect to a player-specified
                                 sound samples within the player's config
                                 file. The sound interface function
                                 pointer used to invoke it:

                                 void (*sound_soundeffect)(char *desc,
                                               int32_t seid, int32_t volume);

    SOUND_TRIGGER_AMBIENCE       Invoked by the core in response to something
                                 atmosphere or mood-producing or flavorful.
                                 Unlike the other interface functions, this
                                 one gets called to notify the sound interface
                                 at the outset (ambience_begin), at the
                                 termination (ambience_end), and
                                 periodically in-between as needed
                                 (ambience_upate), likely with a different
                                 hero proximity value.

    SOUND_TRIGGER_VERBAL         Invoked by the core when someone (or something)
                                 is speaking.


The types of sound sound_triggers supported by a particular soundlib
implementation are specified in that library's soundlib file, which is usually
found in sound/<library_name>/<library_name>.c (.m in the case of macound), in
the sound_triggers field of the sound_procs struct:

    struct sound_procs {
        const char *soundname;
        enum soundlib_ids soundlib_id;
        unsigned long sound_triggers;
        void (*sound_init_nhsound)(void);
        void (*sound_exit_nhsound)(const char *reason);
        void (*sound_achievement)(schar arg1, schar arg2, int32_t avals);
        void (*sound_soundeffect)(char *desc, int32_t, int32_t volume);
        void (*sound_hero_playnotes)(int32_t instrument, const char *notestr,
              int32_t volume);
        void (*sound_play_usersound)(char *filename, int32_t volume,
              int32_t usidx);
        void (*sound_ambience)(int32_t ambienceid, int32_t ambience_action,
              int32_t hero_proximity);
        void (*sound_verbal)(char *text, int32_t gender, int32_t tone,
              int32_t vol, int32_t moreinfo);
    };

A sound library integration support file can implement one, two, three, four,
five, or six of the sound trigger types. The more types of sound_triggers the
soundlib implements, the more full-featured the sound experience will be
during the game.

The values can be or'd together in the sound_triggers field initialization.
    SOUND_TRIGGER_USERSOUNDS | SOUND_TRIGGER_HEROMUSIC
        | SOUND_TRIGGER_ACHIEVEMENTS | SOUND_TRIGGER_SOUNDEFFECTS
        | SOUND_TRIGGER_AMBIENCE | SOUND_TRIGGER_VERBAL


II.  Interface Specification

A.  Integration routines:

All functions below are void unless otherwise noted.

sound_init_nhsound(void);

    -- NetHack will call this function when it is ready to enable sound
       library support. It will do that during start-up, and it might do
       it if the player has chosen to switch soundlib options.

sound_exit_nhsound(const char *reason);

    -- NetHack will call this function when it wants to turn off the
       sound library support and make it inactive. It will do that
       when the game is ending, whether because the game is over or
       because the player has chosen to save the game. The function
       might also get called if the player has chosen to switch soundlib
       options.

sound_achievement(schar arg1, schar arg2, int32_t avals);

    -- NetHack will call this function when it wants to invoke a sound
       based on an achievement, or an event that has occurred in the
       game.
    -- arg1 will contain the achievement value used internal to the
       game, and if it is non-zero then arg2 should be ignored.
    -- avals may contain more specific information about the achievement
       or event that has just occurred.
       For internal achievements (non-zero arg1), it will be zero if
       this is the first occurrence of that achievement, or it will be
       non-zero if this is a repeat occurrence.
    -- arg2 is only used when arg1 iz zero. arg2 contains event
       identifiers for various events that occur during the game. The
       identifiers are from the 'enum achievements_arg2' list in
       include/sndprocs.h. It is recommended that you look them up
       there as new ones get added periodically as the game development
       continues. The identifiers all begin with 'sa2_'.
       For arg2 events, avals may contain additional integer information
       specific to that particular event. For other events, it may be
       meaningless. Those relationships will also be documented in
       include/sndprocs.h as they develop.

sound_soundeffect(char *desc, int32_t seid, int32_t volume);

    -- NetHack will call this function when it wants to invoke a particular
       sound effect during the course of a game. The calls are typically
       hard-coded into the NetHack sources at various appropriate points,
       and the calls typically use the Soundeffects(desc, seid, volume)
       macro to do so. They benefit of using the macro is that it does some
       suitable validation checks before actually invoking the soundlib
       function.
    -- desc may hold a text description of the sound effect. Often this
       field is not set, so the soundlib routine needs to be aware of
       that and not depend on it holding a description.
    -- The soundeffects identifiers (seid) are from the
       'enum sound_effect_entries' list in include/sndprocs.h.
       It is recommended that you look them up there as new ones get
       added periodically as game development continues. The identifiers
       all begin with 'se_'.

sound_hero_playnotes(int32_t instrument, const char *notestr, int32_t volume);

    -- NetHack will call this function when it wants a sequence of notes
       (A,B,C,D,E,F,G) played, because the hero in the game, or a
       creature in the game, is playing an instrument.
    -- instrument specifies the instrument to use. The instrument
       identifiers are from the 'enum instruments' list in
       include/sndprocs.h.  It is recommended that you look them up
       there as new ones get added periodically as game development
       continues. The identifiers all begin with 'ins_'.
       Side note: the underlying values associated with those enums
       match the instrument values in some MIDI specifications. If
       they match the values for instruments in the underlying sound
       library or platform API, they may be able to be passed through.
    -- The sequence of notes is in notestr. At this time, NetHack may
       be capping the number of notes at 5, but it is not
       recommended that the soundlib integration support functions
       rely on that note count cap as a hard rule.
    -- A soundlib integration support file that has SOUND_TRIGGER_HEROMUSIC
       support is expected to play the sound at the volume specified
       by the volume argument (1 - 100, representing percentage of
       possible volume levels), if the underlying sound library supports
       volume adjustments. If it doesn't, the volume argument would
       just have to be ignored.

sound_play_usersound(char *filename, int32_t volume, int32_t usidx);

    -- NetHack will call this function when it wants a particular
       external sound file played, based on a regular expression match
       that the player has defined in their config file.
    -- A soundlib integration support file that has SOUND_TRIGGER_USERSOUNDS
       support is expected to play the sound file specified by the filename
       argument.
    -- A soundlib integration support file that has SOUND_TRIGGER_USERSOUNDS
       support is expected to play the sound at the volume specified
       by the volume argument (1 - 100, representing percentage of
       possible volume levels), if the underlying sound library supports
       volume adjustments. If it doesn't, the volume argument would
       just have to be ignored.

sound_ambience(int32_t ambienceid, int32_t ambience_action,
               int32_t hero_proximity);
    -- NetHack will call this function when it wants a particular
       ambience related sound played in order to provide atomosphere
       or flavor.
    -- The ambienceid is used to identify the particular ambience sound
       being sought. The abienceid identifiers are from the
       'enum ambiences' list in include/sndprocs.h.  It is recommended
       that you look them up there as new ones get added periodically
       as game development continues. The identifiers all begin
       with 'amb_'.
    -- ambience_action. A soundlib integration support file that has
       SOUND_TRIGGER_AMBIENCE support is expected to commence playing the
       sound when it receives an ambience_action of ambience_begin. It
       will receive an ambience_action of ambience_end when it should cease
       playing the sound. It may receive an ambience_action of
       ambience_update periodically, anytime the ambience is underway,
       and it should respond accordingly: perhaps by adjusting the nature
       of the sound being heard, or possibly by just adjusting the volume.
    -- hero_proximity could be zero, in which case the ambience being
       triggered is not impacted by the hero's distance from anything.
       If the distance of the hero from the source of the ambience does
       matter, then a distance value will be in hero_proximity.

sound_verbal(char *text, int32_t gender, int32_t tone, int32_t vol,
             int32_t moreinfo);
    -- NetHack will call this function when it wants to pass text of
       spoken language by a character or creature within the game.
    -- text is a transcript of what has been spoken.
    -- gender indicates MALE or FEMALE or NEUTRAL (either MALE
       or FEMALE) voice.
    -- tone indicates the tone of the voice.
    -- vol is the volume (1% - 100%) for the sound.
    -- moreinfo is used to provide additional information to the soundlib.
    -- there may be some accessibility uses for this function.


III.  Global variables

The following global variables are defined in decl.c and are related to
the soundlib support in some way. They are just being documented here,
Some of them are expected to be used by the soundlib support file,
particularly where the core options interface is responsible for
setting the values.

[TO BE DONE]

soundprocs
gc.chosen_soundlib
ga.active_soundlib
a usersound mappings reference

iflags.sounds is the master on/off swith to control whether any audio
is produced by the soundlib interface

iflags.voice is the master on/off switch for voices produced by
the soundlib interface.

IV.   Other related routines

These are not part of the interface, but mentioned here for your information.

assign_soundlib(soundlib_identifier)

    -- Places a value into gc.chosen_soundlib as a "hint" that the
       particular soundlib support is compiled in and thus available.

activate_chosen_soundlib(void)

    -- If a soundlib is already active, indicated by ga.active_soundlib
       holding the identifier of one of the added soundlib integrations,
       then the sound_exit_nhsound() is called to turn it off or
       deactivate it.
    -- The soundlib identified in gc.chosen_soundlib is activated by
       updating ga.active_soundlib, copying the chosen interface's
       sound_proc structure into soundprocs, and calling the
       soundlib interface's sound_init_nhsound() function.

V.   Game Start-up and Soundlib Activation Sequencing

The following is the general order of calls that lead to soundlib
activation.

    1. assign_soundlib(soundlib_identifier)

       The platform-specific main, or in the case of at least one
       sound library that is integrated with the full visual/window
       support (Qt) - the win_init_nhwindows() routine, drops
       a hint about a supported soundlib by calling assign_soundlib.

    [The window interface has already been enabled by this point,
     meaning that its win_init_nhwindows() has already been called.
     That's important because for at least one of the soundlibs (Qt),
     it is the window interface becoming active, and thus initializing
     the underlying framework that includes both display and sound,
     that has caused assign_soundlib() to be called again to indicate
     that its soundlib interface routines are now the preferred soundlib
     routines to use. That will have superseded the gc.chosen_soundlib
     value that the platform's main() may have placed there earlier
     via its own call to assign_soundlib()]

    2. init_sound_disp_gamewindows()
           ->  activate_chosen_soundlib() is called prior to
               displaying the game windows.

VI.  Conventions

[to be done]

The windsound soundlib is contained in sound/windsound, the macsound
soundlib is contained in sound/macsound.  The files in these directories
contain _only_ soundlib code, and may be replaced completely by other
soundlib support.


VII.  Implementation and Multiple Soundlib Support


Multiple soundlib routines are supported in the same binary.
When writing a new set of sound library integration routines
use the following guidelines:

1) Pick a unique name to identify your soundlib.  The default
   built-in soundlib uses "nosound". Your name pick should make it
   obvious which 3rd party sound library you are writing your
   interface glue-code for.
2) When declaring your soundlib interface functions, precede the
   function names with your unique prefix.  For example,

	void myprefix_init_nhsound()
	{
	    /* code for initializing the underlying sound library */
	}

   When/if calling one your own soundlib functions from within your
   soundlib code (one calling another), we suggest calling the
   prefixed version to avoid unnecessary overhead of using the
   soundprocs function pointer.

   We also suggest declaring all functions (not just the interface
   functions) with the prefix, or declare them static, to avoid
   unexpected overlaps with other soundlibs. The same applies to
   file-scope data variables.

3) Declare a structure, "struct sound_procs myprefix_procs", (with your
   prefix instead of "myprefix") and fill in names of all of your
   interface functions. All functions specified as part of the interface
   must be present, even if they have empty function bodies.

       struct sound_procs myprefix_procs = {
           SOUNDID(myprefix),
           SOUND_TRIGGER_USERSOUNDS | SOUND_TRIGGER_HEROMUSIC
              | SOUND_TRIGGER_ACHIEVEMENTS |SOUND_TRIGGER_SOUNDEFFECTS
              | SOUND_TRIGGER_AMBIENCE | SOUND_TRIGGER_VERBAL,
           myprefix_init_nhsound,
           myprefix_exit_nhsound,
           myprefix_achievement,
           myprefix_soundeffect,
           myprefix_hero_playnotes,
           myprefix_play_usersound,
           myprefix_ambience,
           myprefix_verbal),
       };

   The first entry in this structure should be the SOUNDID(myprefix)
   where myprefix should be the name of your soundlib port.
   After that, the next entry is the sound_triggers mask that identifies
   what sound_triggers your soundlib will actually react to and
   support. Don't include the sound_triggers values for functions that are
   empty, so that the NetHack core code won't bother trying to call
   them. The other entries are the function addresses.

   Assuming that you followed the convention in (2), you can safely copy
   the structure definition from the sample skeleton located below in
   this document and just change the prefix from "sample" to your prefix.

4) Add a new section to the 'enum soundlib_ids' in include/sndprocs.h,
   just above the entry for 'soundlib_notused'. There are some
   placeholders for some soundlib possibilities in there already. You
   can skip this step if your prefix matches one of those, as long as
   it is unused and you aren't colliding with work already done. Check
   for a subdirectory in sounds as a reliable indicator of whether it
   is already being used.

   Enclose your new section in #ifdef preprocessor directive prefixed
   with "SND_LIB_" (without the quotes) and the uppercase variation of
   your soundlib name.

       #ifdef SND_LIB_MYPREFIX
           soundlib_myprefix,
       #endif

   Again, place that in the enum above the entry for 'soundlib_notused'.

5) Edit mdlib.c and add an entry for your soundlib to the
   soundlib_information soundlib_opts[] array
   right above the final "{ 0, 0, 0, FALSE }," entry.

       #ifdef SND_LIB_MYPREFIX
            { soundlib_myprefix, "soundlib_myprefix",
                "<url goes here>", FALSE },
       #endif


6) Edit include/sndprocs.h and add yours to the multiline #if defined
   used to #define SND_LIB_INTEGRATED when none of the active soundlibs
   and placeholders are defined.
       #if defined(SND_LIB_QTSOUND) || defined(SND_LIB_PORTAUDIO) \
            || defined(SND_LIB_OPENAL) || defined(SND_LIB_SDL_MIXER) \
            || defined(SND_LIB_MINIAUDIO) || defined(SND_LIB_FMOD) \
            || defined(SND_LIB_SOUND_ESCCODES) || defined(SND_LIB_VISSOUND) \
            || defined(SND_LIB_WINDSOUND) || defined(SND_LIB_MACSOUND) \
            || defined(SND_LIB_MYPREFIX)

       #define SND_LIB_INTEGRATED
       [...]

7) Edit sounds.c and add the extern entry for your soundlib's sound_procs
   struct, enclosed with an #ifdef SND_LIB_MYPREFIX block.

       #ifdef SND_LIB_MYPREFIX
       extern struct sound_procs myprefix_procs;
       #endif


8) Also while editing sounds.c, add a reference for your myprefix_procs
   as the last entry in the soundlib_choices[] array initializations,
   enclosed with and #ifdef SND_LIB_MYPREFIX block.

       #ifdef SND_LIB_MYPREFIX
           { &myprefix_procs },
       #endif

9) If the soundlib you are using work across multiple (more than one)
   platform, several files related to building for the various
   systems and/or build tools will likely require updates in order
   for them to be able to compile for, and link with, your soundlib
   interface support and the underlying sound library it is meant to
   use. This part often isn't particularly fun. The build tools are
   all quite different, and many developers only understand the build
   system for one platform/system better than others. It typically
   comes down to experience and familiarity.

   Don't be afraid to get assistance with unfamiliar ones.

   Generally speaking, build tools need to know about:
       - changes that are needed to include C preprocessor defines
         for enabling the inclusion of your soundlib support on the
         compiler command line for all NetHack files
         ( -DSND_LIB_MYPREFIX ).
       - changes that are needed to include header files supplied
         by the underlying sound library, so they can be found
         via include path updates on the compiler command line
         ( -I../lib/myprefix/inc).
       - changes that are needed to link in the sound library
         itself during the linking stage of the build
         ( -L ../lib/myprefix/lib/myprefix.lib ).

   Here are some known examples of what might have to change
   at the time of this writing:

       sys/unix/hints/*
                        These hints files might require updates to
                        include your new soundlib addition. You can
                        look at what was done for macsound support
                        in sys/unix/hints/macOS.370 for inspiration.

       sys/unix/NetHack.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj

                        Will require updates in order to build with
                        Xcode on macOS.

       sys/windows/Makefile.nmake

                        Will require updates in order to build on
                        Windows with Visual studio nmake at the command
                        line.

       sys/windows/Makefile.mingw32
       sys/windows/Makefile.mingw32.depend

                        Will require updates in order to build on
                        Windows with mingw32 or MSYS2 using GNU make at
                        the command line.

       sys/windows/vs/NetHackW/NetHackW.vcxproj

                        Will need an <ClCompile Include="$(SndWindDir)myprefix.c" />
                        entry added in order to build under visual
                        studio, and additional updates to link in the
                        underlying sound library, if it requires one.

10) Look at your soundlib support file in sound/myprefix/myprefix.c
   and make sure that all of the calls match the requirements laid out in
   Section VI and VII.

What follows is a sample soundlib interface that can be used as a
starting template.
