NHDT-Branch: NetHack-3.7 $:$NHDT-Revision: 1.309 $ $NHDT-Date: 1600933440 2020/09/24 07:44:00 $

General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
hero polymorphed into a vampire can use #monster to shape-shift rather than
	just do a one-shot polymorph into bat/cloud/wolf and shifted vampire
	hero can use #monster again to take on another form (randomly chosen
	among the shiftable shapes and true vampire form)
adjust bones filename buffer sizes to accommodate suffix
fix internal self-recover to work with recent fields added to checkpoint file
improvements to pronoun usage when hallucinating
function calls made from mapglyph based on dungeon level are now called once
	per level
fast hero could have random clairvoyance happen more than once on same turn
using 'Q' on wielded weapon would offer to split stack; make using 'w' on a
	quivered stack behave similarly
weight for giant spider was too low for creature of size 'large';
	weight for giant beetle was much too low for 'large'
leave some menu items out of "invert all" via '@' when their inclusion would
	degrade the usefulness of that interface feature
change crysknife from mineral to bone and worm tooth from unspecified to bone
worn meat ring shouldn't cause increased hunger; neither should fake Amulet
worn +0 ring of protection should cause increased hunger if it is the only
	source of extrinsic Protection
monster wielding Stormbringer or healer's Staff against another monster would
	heal the hero instead of the wielding monster when draining life
change twoweapon feedback from "not a weapon" to "not a suitable weapon"
don't allow twoweapon combat if either weapon is a bow, crossbow, or sling
	[later: or arrows, bolts, and missiles (darts, shuriken, boomerangs)]
drum of earthquake feedback reported various things (fountains, thrones, &c)
	falling into a chasm but they remained intact because trap creation
	had been changed to not clobber such things (so couldn't make pits)
make earthquake which hits a secret door or a secret corridor reveal it
wizard mode wishing for "Amulet of Yendor" had 50:50 chance for true Amulet
	or a cheap plastic imitation; recognize "real Amulet of Yendor" and
	"fake Amulet of Yendor" to precisely specify either of them but also
	take away the 50% chance of yielding a fake one when neither real nor
	fake is specified
unpaid globs showed weight info unconditionally outside of wizmode
walking out of tethered-to-buried-object trap condition was supposed to
	reinstate punishment but wasn't finding the buried iron ball because
	the trap condition was cleared first to indicate escape; result was
	attached chain that got dragged around but had no ball attached
when poly'd into a giant and moving onto a boulder's spot, message given was
	confused about whether autopickup would occur so could be misleading
random role selection wasn't honoring unwanted alignment(s) properly
if at the edge of the map window, trying to move farther fails but used a turn
hero can no longer wear blindfold/towel/lenses when poly'd into headless form
revamp achievement tracking for exploring Mine's End and Sokoban (by acquiring
	luckstone and bag of holding or amulet of reflection, respectively)
throttle long worm growth rate and HP accumulation
poly'd hero was able to zap wands, apply tools, and #rub objects without
	having any hands
spellcasting monster got an extra move after casting
allow defining #wizgenesis quantity in the prompt
digging through iron bars from an adjacent pit made a pit on top of the bars
give feedback if controlled level teleport attempt fails because hero is
	already on the bottom level and player tries to go even deeper
unseen pet that drowned didn't give "you have a sad feeling" message
prevent ravens from blinding other ravens: /corvus oculum corvi non eruit/
have ^X provide more information when held or swallowed
display wasn't updating immediately after toggling hilite_pet option
randomly choosing role could lead to crash via segfault
if eel bite attack caused hero to move (killed + rehumanized + crawled out
	of water), its grab attack could succeed even if no longer adjacent
specifying a count when picking [part of] a stack of scrolls of scare monster
	ignored that count and the whole stack was affected
wizmakemap didn't account for unique monsters and didn't correct monster
	birth counts
generate objects (eg. statues) with genocided or extinct monster classes
	in special levels, if requested
if the orc-town version of mine town has been loaded, creation of orc zombies
	or orc mummies would name them as part of the town raiding orc clan
when punished, involuntarily teleporting and landing within chain range of
	attached ball while encumbered worse than burdened could trigger
	"remove_object: obj not on floor" panic on hero's next move
inventory cursing caused by "this water's no good" effect when drinking from
	a fountain didn't update persistent inventory window
fix priest created inside temple wall
fix vault guard occasionally encasing monsters in stone
tone down scare monster by excluding humans and uniques
lock the castle chest
revamp amnesia to forget skills instead of objects or maps
when Punished and carrying the iron ball and levitating, hurtling in the
	opposite direction of a thrown object didn't bring along the chain
recognize "kirin" as alias for "ki-rin" when asked to create a monster
make unique swallowing monsters (Juiblex) resist magical digging from inside
correctly account for fuel remaining when lit candles are attached
	to candelabrum (the previous code would make the game unwinnable if
	there were 15 or fewer turns remaining)
praying on an unaligned altar outside of Gehennom behaved like an ordinary
	prayer; make that always fail
Discworld typo: Moving Pictures passage 12 "or" -> "of"
unicorn corpses and wraith corpses could be sacrificed even if "too old"
hero polymorphed into a hider and hiding was not unhidden when teleporting
impose tighter restraints on 'summon nasties', both for spellcasting monsters
	and post-Wizard harassment
prevent swallowing monster ending up in a solid wall if it killed vault guard
fix attached ball getting deallocated if swallowed, going down into a pit,
	and saving
level compiler creates correct novel with supplied name
for farlook, describe water in the castle moat and in Juiblex's swamp as moat
	and as swamp, respectively, rather than just as "water"
make hezrous emit poison clouds when they move
stepping from one type of terrain to another was triggering an unnecessary
	status update
make shriekers summon baby purple worms if purple worms would be too tough
make non-tame (baby) purple worms eat corpses off the ground
make baby purple worms attack shriekers
make hero polymorphed into baby purple worm warned against shriekers
confused scroll of light summons tame cancelled lights
potions of hallucination can give enlightenment
add a small chance of surviving food poisoning
deliberate level teleporter activation ignores magic resistance
auto-id scroll of remove curse when a known buc-state was changed
demon lords hate Demonbane
pets avoid eating shapeshifter corpses unless starving or nearly feral
blessed scroll of teleportation gives a single controlled teleport
allow opening a tin without interruption if slimed
tell player when wielding a different weapon toggles off dual-wielding
object taking erosion damage might give feedback message when out of view
	or not give such when in view, depending on stale value of 'bhitpos'
	[cited case assumed message came from drowned monster's dropped
	inventory when out-of-view ice melted]
it's possible to wish for tins of the Riders in wizard mode; eating one is
	fatal but if you're life-saved or decline to die, the game crashed
revival via undead turning of corpse carried by hero said "your <mon> corpse
	comes alive" even when revived monster was undead
prevent searching or waiting next to a hostile monster - override with 'm'
allow random mimics to show up mimicing more furniture than just stairs
scatter exploding bag of holding contents instead of outright deleting them
male hero poly'd into nymph chooses charm vs seduce message based on being
	male rather than on all nymphs being female but charm message was
	using hardcoded pronouns She,her for target monster--wrong for male
	target and noticable if "<mon> finishes taking off his suit" is given
hostile monsters with launcher and ammo try to stay away from melee range
allow displacing peaceful creatures
unicorn horns don't restore attribute loss anymore
when a shop is changed from food to health food, change room type to match
wish parsing of things containing monster names would accept all supported
	alternate spellings if they occurred at the end ("corpse of mumakil")
	but only some when they occurred elsewhere ("gray-elf corpse" worked,
	"mumakil corpse" yielded "does not exist") depending upon name length
couldn't wish for werecreature corpse or tin because monster name lookup
	always matched the beast form which is flagged no-corpse; switch to
	human form for "were<creature>"
wishing for werecreature figurine always made one that created the monster in
	beast form if activated; allow "human were<creature>" to explicitly
	specify werecreature's human form (for corpses and tins as well as
	figurines); override the restriction against human figurines for that
wishing for "royal jelly" yielded "lump of royal jelly" as a special case, but
	other 'of' items such as "clove of garlic", "sprig of wolfsbane", or
	"piece of cloth" didn't allow using their post-of words as shorthand
monster or object detection found semi-dead vault guard at <0,0> while
	traversing fmon list; monster detection gave misleading feedback
	(blank map instead of 'strange feeling') if there were no other
	monsters on level; likewise object detection and guard's minvent
squadprob[] in mkroom.c was defined with 5 elements but initialized only 4
	resulting in giant ants sometimes
allow nurses heal attack when wielding a non-weapon/weaptool
if riding or levitating, hero could apply bullwhip downward to pull up things
	from underwater or lava; feedback implied the item was on the surface
some monster code was checking whether pets or engulfers were eating green
	slime by checking for green slime corpse instead of glob
change light radius of stack of candles to square root
could get redundate "mon hits other-mon" messages when mon wields an artifact
failed untrap while mounted that moved hero onto the trap would leave steed
	with stale coordinates, triggering warnings if 'sanity_check' is On
when digging a pit results in it being filled by adjacent pool or lava, any
	objects at the spot weren't subjected to water or fire damage;
	also, riding hero's steed wasn't subjected to immersion either
after "double trouble", cloned Wizard would wait until he had suffered some
	damage or hero moved into direct view; keep STRAT_WAIT for original
	Wizard but avoid that for clones
beyond turn 100000, prayer timeout is longer (scaling with game length)
falling while going down stairs and dropping items due to encumbrance or
	punishment wasn't subjecting fragile ones to breakage
objects scattered by an explosion which land on water or lava weren't affected
	by the water or lava
hold_another_object (for wishing, horn of plenty, theft while poly'd, other
	non-pickup actions giving hero another inventory item) wasn't
	reporting change in encumbrance; that would catch up on next turn but
	could be off during additional move(s) for current turn
hold_another_object added item to inventory first, then maybe removed and
	dropped it, resulting in spurious add and remove perm_invent updates
hold_another_object used hardcoded Stressed to limit carrying instead of
	using the 'pickup_burden' option for that
when hold_another_object fails while hero is swallowed, drop the item into
	swallower's inventory instead of onto the floor
change mkclass() to usually honor (always honor for L class) the hell-only and
	never-in-hell monster creation flags; no more achi-lich in the Castle
	(nor master lich there unless demilich gets a potion of gain level)
thieving monster could be killed while hero was removing armor, triggering
	warning "stealarm(): dead monster stealing" when taking-off finished
petrifying a long worm and then reanimating it handled tail incorrectly;
	with sanity_check On, X coordinate of head segment was reported as 0
attempting to read a novel while blind reported "you can't read the mystic
	runes" like for a spellbook; use "you can't read the words" for novel
don't let life draining reduce a monster's max HP below its level + 1
report "<Mon> expires" rather than "<Mon> dies" if polymorphed hero kills a
	non-living monster (golem, vortex) with life drain (vampire bite)
allow hero in silver-hating form to ring the silver bell but only if on/over
	the vibrating square
reading the Book of the Dead while blind is allowed; doing so gives
	"you turn the pages of the Book of the Dead" and the type of item
	becomes discovered, but the object wasn't being flagged as 'dknown'
	so if not seen yet it remained "a spellbook" in hero's inventory
reading cursed Book of the Dead while blind gave feedback for sighted hero
reading non-cursed Book of the Dead after prepping with the other tools gave
	a message referring to those as "artifacts" if either of them were
	cursed; those unique items aren't artifacts so use "relics" instead
zapping a line of boulders with striking or force bolt was updating 'couldsee'
	but deferring 'cansee', resulting in seeing the first boulder fracture
	and only hearing that happen for the others despite coming into view
the default engraving, epitaph, and bogus monster inserted by 'makedefs -s'
	(3.6.6 fix for empty source data file) lacked terminating newline, so
	when the corresponding file wasn't actually empty its first line ended
	up concatenated; default portion of the bad combined entry would be
	decrypted properly but the portion from the file's first line wouldn't
if the Wizard of Yendor fled up the stairs on level 1, the game would behave
	as if he was still in play, but he wouldn't be on migrating monsters
	list so couldn't be brought back and wouldn't appear on Plane of Earth
	(stale non-zero value for context.no_of_wizards)
if a mind flayer's psychic blast targetted a hidden monster, feedback named
	the monster but it wasn't brought out of hiding
hero poly'd into a mind flayer who used #monster to emit a psychic blast was
	able to harm mindless monsters with it
some hero attacks that should have gotten a skill bonus or penalty didn't
change internal name of "<foo> venom" to "splash of <foo> venom"
singularize "splashes" to "splash" instead of "splashe"
treat slinging gems and tossing or slinging stones at unicorns as attacks
give rot-away timer instead of revive timer to corpses of cancelled trolls
switch revive timer to rot-away timer if a troll corpse gets cancelled
uncancel an ice troll if its corpse is put into an ice box; give corpse a
	revive timer if later taken out
splitting a stack of candy bars gave new wrapper text depending upon the
	obj->o_id value assigned; keep existing text for both halves of stack
	(side-effect: separate candy bars usually won't merge anymore)
describing tin variety (deep fried, pureed, &c) relied on the 'contents known'
	flag but object identification wasn't setting obj->cknown for tins
wizard mode #wizintrinsic: setting Levitation wouldn't block Flying as
	intended because the check for that was being made too soon
chatting to the quest leader in wizard mode with sufficient experience level
	and insufficient piety, player is asked whether alignment should be
	boosted; answering 'n' resulted in being prompted a second time
leashing or unleashing pets wasn't updating persistent inventory window
end of game inventory disclosure passed an inappropriate argument to the
	inventory display routine; not noticeable for tty and curses,
	noticeable but not harmful for X11, and slightly harmful for Qt
turning into slime rendered hero as slime one turn too soon
avoid potential infinite loop if hangup occurs at ring "right or left?" prompt
randomize the turns where accessories and extrinsics affect nutrition
handle being interrupted by approaching monsters more consistently
if hero attacked a peaceful monster, some other peaceful monsters with humanoid
	shape (minotaur, zruty, perhaps others) that witnessed it but which
	shouldn't be capable of normal speech expressed their surprise audibly
make gasp/exclamation message from peaceful monsters be more verbose to
	indicate which monster is doing the gasping or exclaiming
when make was invoked with -j makedefs instances could end up running in
	parallel and could trample on each other's temp files; default to
	using mkstemp(); allow a port runtime library implementation that lacks
	mkstemp() to define HAS_NO_MKSTEMP to revert to the old behaviour;
	provide a work-alike mkstemp() implementation for windows visual studio
	in mdlib.c so there is no requirement to define HAS_NO_MKSTEMP there


Fixes to 3.7.0-x Problems that Were Exposed Via git Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------
fix compile when DLB isn't defined
urealtime.realtime was being incorrectly calculated
revised "mysterious force" when climbing out of gehennom could generate
	warnings about "rn2(0) attempted" or "rn2(-n) attempted"
after 'w' on split stack patch, wielding '-' would cause an object_lost panic
same patch allowed partial stack from getobj to replace cursed wielded weapon
autounlock of door or chest took no time; chest case depended on whether
	anything got looted along with the unlocking
autounlock with artifact unlocking tool didn't do touch check on that tool
autounlock picked Rogue's artifact key over lock-pick or credit card (or
	ordinary key depending upon invent order) even for non-rogues who
	would be blasted when touching it
wielded aklys had its "(tethered weapon...)" description scrambled
randomized trap name could pick trap #0 which isn't a trap and yielded "water"
if running and Blind or Stunned or Fumbling or Dex < 10, encountering a closed
	door orthogonally would keep reporting "ouch! you bump into a door"
	repeatedly until eventually interrupted by approaching monster or
	hunger or ^C
data.base lookup of an entry with any blank lines would falsely claim that
	"'data' file in wrong fromat or corrupted" after some extra checks
	were added while investigating tab handling anomalies
using nhl_error() to report a Lua processing problem would clobber the stack
level teleporation's "You materialize on a different level!" could be given
	out of sequence with other arrival messages
more sequencing: if wielding Sting or similar and level teleporting to a
	level with different warning effect, the start-glowing or stop-glowing
	message came before the materialize message on the destination level
prevent "you materialize on a different level" after "a mysterious force
	prevents you from descending" if you try to level teleport past the
	stairs down from the quest home level before being granted access
creating Mine Town variant 1 (Orcish Town) sometimes complained about being
	unable to place lregion type 1 and failed to have any staircase up
set g.context.botl for glove and wielding actions that could start or end
	bare-handedness in support of condtests[bl_bareh]
reinstate ranked ordering of the status condition fields
grammar for messages about a monster removing items from a container was bad
some new status conditions didn't always update when they should
fix flipping non-existent stairs and ladders (github #311)
fix door created into random wall or position opening into solid wall
handle gone portal when going back in quest
'use_inverse' option was accidentally made Windows-only; change it back to
	being more general; change its default to True
change inconsistent achievement spelling of "Mine Town" to "Minetown"
fix crash in water_damage_chain
teleport feedback "you materialize at another location" was given too soon
'mention_decore' was repeatedly reporting "you are back on bottom" when
	moving around underwater
revised 'mention_decor' was describing furniture or ice right before look-here
	described the same thing when stepping onto object(s)
poison gas clouds located over known but unlit pools were visible as known
	clouds but steam clouds in that situation were not
after the wish parsing change, wishing for "<something of monster>" or for
	"<monster something>" worked as intended but wishing for "<monster>"
	(where <monster> used the canonical spelling) triggered a crash
fix new "objects[0] class #1 not in order!" panic if plain 'char' is unsigned
only generate shop items on solid floor squares
avoid gcc 10 warning by removing duplicate definition of 'head_engr'
if a monster removed a corpse from an ice box, the corpse would never rot away
monster creation on quest levels could make genocided creatures
enabling wizard mode 'sanity_check' option would complain about invalid mhpmax
	value for level N monsters created with a d8 value of 1 for all N d8's
disable that extra check because gremlim HP split after cloning triggers it
some versions of tiles processing (not X11's) complained about the rename of
	"{acid,blinding} venom" to "splash of {acid,blinding} venom"
wizard mode #timeout changed to show timed Displacement in 'can be timed in
	normal play' section instead of 'timed via #wizintrinsic only' section
the fix to make worm visibility checks work as intended forced the coordinates
	of the extra tail segment co-located with the worm monster to match
	the worm instead of leaving it off the map; place_worm_tail_randomly()
	reverses the segments and can throw some away if there isn't room,
	but throwing away the extra segment removed the worm from the map
using 'O' to try to change 'symset' was a no-op; 'roguesymset' worked
change default for lit attribute in special level des.terrain directives to
	'unchanged' instead of 'unlit'
replace worm tail placement code that reportedly led to a sanity_check warning
	[no actual code problem found; might be compiler bug for 'xchar']
learn scroll of teleportation after reading even when random destination is
	right by starting spot
fix off-by-one bug in dimensions of theme rooms

curses: 'msg_window' option wasn't functional for curses unless the binary
	also included tty support
tty: redraw unexplored locations as S_unexplored rather than <space> after
	map has been partially overwritten by popup menu or text display
tty: previous change resulted in remnants of previous level being shown on
	new level after level change when S_unexplored is <space>
Unix: after lua changes to Makefiles, 'make spotless' for dat subdirectory
	left some generated data files which should have been deleted
X11: was still initializing map to 'stone' instead of 'unexplored' after they
	became separate glyphs
X11: for text map without color, add support for black&white ice; draw it in
	inverse video to distinguish from ordinary floor


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes
-----------------------------------------
SYSCF: treat most sysconf directives that have invalid values as warnings
	rather than errors; use a conservative default value and continue
curses: for vertical status, line up conditions in columns; usually two but
	condense to three per line if the status window isn't tall enough
	[at present, highlighting with inverse video includes trailing spaces
	used to align entries in their columns--that's a feature...]
msdos: add -DSTATUES_LOOK_LIKE_MONSTERS to Makefile1.cross so the VESA mode
	can display statue glyphs
Qt: quit if can't load tiles file instead of continuing and then segfaulting
Qt: [later] tiles load failure at startup now continues using an ascii map
Qt: use more columns for extended command selection dialog so that the number
	of rows needed doesn't result in some commands being unaccessible
Qt: suppress wizard mode commands from '#' handling when not in wizard mode
Qt: organize extended command selection grid by columns instead of by rows
	(first N entries down left column, next N entries down 2nd column, &c)
Qt: when selecting an extended command by typing its name, support <delete>
	(aka <rubout>) in addition to <backspace> to go back a character
Qt: switch to fixed-width font for menus
Qt: don't disable [cancel] button when viewing inventory or other pick-none
	menus; ESC works to dismiss those and [cancel] should be the same
Qt: bring status conditions up to 3.6 levels but new ones lack pictures
Qt: clicking on the window's Close button brought up a dialog offering
	choices of "Save" and "Cancel"; picking Cancel sent nethack into an
	infinite loop with complaints about Qt's event loop already being
	active; change dialog: offer "Save and exit" or "Quit without saving"
	with no opportunity to try to back out of the Close operation
Qt: add 3.6 status fields Stone, Slime, Strngl, Deaf, Lev, Fly, Ride
Qt: add Attributes, Overview, and Annotate to the "Info" pull down menu
Qt: rename menu entries game->Save to game->Save-and-exit and game->Quit
	to game->Quit-without-saving
Qt: menu commands are now working; commands invoked via M-c were having that
	keystroke changed to '?', bringing up nethack's help menu; now those
	send #abc with just enough letters to disambiguate from other commands
	("Compilation" is one remaining problem; it yields "#version" which
	brings up '#' menu subset with choices of "version" and "versionshort")
Qt: "paper doll" subset of persistent inventory has undergone several changes:
	show previously missing quiver below weapon instead of duplicating
	gloves there; show secondary weapon in shield slot and blank out
	alternate weapon slot when two-weapon combat is active; show wielded
	two-handed weapon in both the shield and primary weapon slots; show
	first active light source in a previously unused slot on lower right;
	show first leash-in-use in a previously unused slot on lower left
Qt: paper doll inventory view was inconsistently updated during Hallucination
Qt: when hero died, gold on tombstone only included gold in inventory, not
	any additional gold inside carried containers; also, inventory gold
	will be zero if bones get created for all 3.6.x and for 3.4.x+GOLDOBJ
Qt: tombstone showed newly constructed date instead of the value set up at
	time of death; it only shows year but that could be wrong if player
	stared at or ignored prior --More-- for long enough on 31 December
Qt: menu choices All, None, Invert were setting, unsetting, or toggling menu
	entry checkboxes internally but didn't redraw the menu to show that
Qt: fix the F1/F2/Tab macro keys to not require that number_pad be On
Qt: unhighlight highlighted message (last one issued) after player has seen it
Qt: update message window's last message with player's response if it's a
	prompt string for a single-character of input (ynaq or invent letter)
Qt: for line input, display the prompt+response in the message window
Qt: enable the popup_dialog WC option (result is a bit flakey but usable)
Qt: 3.6 catchup - show unexplored locations as unexplored rather than as stone
Qt: tried to honor 'showexp' but the value was unintentionally supressed by
	[lack of] obsolete conditional EXP_ON_BOTL
Qt+QSX: fix control key
Qt+OSX: rename menu entry "nethack->Preferences..." for invoking nethack's
	'O' command to "Game->Run-time options" and entry "Game->Qt settings"
	for making persistent Qt customizations to "nethack->Preferences..."
Qt+OSX: prevent game->Quit-without-saving from being hijacked for the nethack
	menu by renaming it game->_Quit-without-saving (OSX only)
Qt+OSX: add a separate nethack->Quit menu entry with different functionality;
	Command+Q invokes it
Qt+OSX: since menu entry help->"About Qt NetHack" gets hijacked and becomes
	"nethack->About nethack", add a separate help->_About_Qt_NetHack_
	which stays where intended and brings up the same information
tiles: add indicator of thonged portion to aklys tile
tty: role and race selection menus weren't filtering out potential choices
	which got excluded by OPTIONS=align:!lawful or !neutral or !chaotic
Unix: when user name is used as default character name, keep hyphenated value
	intact instead stripping off dash and whatever follows as if that
	specified role/race/&c (worked once upon a time; broken since 3.3.0)
Unix: add "ec2-user" to the list of user names 'sysconf' classifies as generic
user_sounds: move the message hook from inside individual window display ports
	to the core where it allows MSGTYP_NOSHOW msgtyp's to still trigger
	sounds to correct a reported github issue; also fixes a past reported
	issue that the curses port on Windows not working with user_sounds
Windows: update for new status condition fields
Windows: include commented-out 'PORTABLE_DEVICE_PATHS' in sysconf.template
X11: substantial overhaul of status display, both 'fancy' and 'tty-style'
X11: extend fancy status one-turn inverse video status-change highlighting to
	hunger, encumbrance, and conditions
X11: stop including unused column 0 in the map


General New Features
--------------------
if a killer bee encounters a lump of royal jelly and there is no queen bee on
	the level, the bee will eat the jelly and become a new queen
automatic annotation "gateway to Moloch's Sanctum" for vibrating square level
	once that square's location becomes known (found or magic mapped);
	goes away once sanctum temple is found (entered or high altar mapped)
savefile: add support to deconstruct internal data structures down into their
	individual fields and save those fields instead of the entire struct
savefile: use little-endian format for fields where that makes a difference
replace build-time level compiler and dungeon compiler with run-time loading of
	the dungeon and level descriptions and interpreting them via Lua
split off some of the functionality that was in makedefs (compiled-in options
	build date/time, etc) so that it can be built by a cross-compiler
	and accessed on the target platform
replace quest.txt and associated conversion to quest.dat via makedefs with
	Lua quest texts loaded at runtime
some altars are displayed in different colors (for tty and curses at least)
add 'quick_farsight' option to provide some control over random clairvoyance
	where pausing to be able to browse temporarily visible aspects of the
	revealed map can seem intrusive; doesn't affect clairvoyance spell
replace "money" in in-game texts with "gold"
when hallucinating, see hallucinated currencies instead of bits for an ale
when hallucinating, see hallucinated liquids when looking at water or lava
	on the map
applying a spellbook hints about read charges left
wizard mode wishing for level topology can now create hidden doors (ask for
	"secret door" when at a door or wall location), hidden corridor
	spots ("secret corridor" at a corridor location), and clouds
tiny chance for randomly created spellbooks to be Discworld novels instead
	of having only one in the first book or scroll shop created (won't
	occur in hero's initial inventory or NPC priest inventory or be
	bestowed as a prayer boon or be found in statues)
'goldX', 'implicit_uncursed', and 'mention_walls' options changed to be
	persistent across save/restore
wearing a wet towel confers "half damage from poison gas" attribute
for end of game disclosure and dumplog, show 'achievements' (previously only
	available as an encoded value in xlogfile) along with 'conduct'
more grades of self-appearance than beautiful or handsome vs ugly
when 'color' if Off and 'use_inverse' is On, draw ice on the map in inverse
	video if it uses the same character as room floor or as dark floor

Platform- and/or Interface-Specific New Features
------------------------------------------------
user_sounds: provide an experimental mechanism for terminal-side sounds similar
	to the method used for vt_tiledata; new option vt_sounddata that also
	requires compile-time definition of TTY_SOUND_ESCCODES (also requires
	terminal-side code external to NetHack to recognize the sequence and
	act on it)
Qt: the "paper doll" inventory subset can be controlled via the "Qt Settings"
	dialog box ("Preferences..." on OSX)
Qt: draw a border around each tile in the paper door inventory; when BUC is
	known for a doll item, change the border's color and thicken it
