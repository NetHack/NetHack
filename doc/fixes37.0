NHDT-Branch: NetHack-3.7 $:$NHDT-Revision: 1.630 $ $NHDT-Date: 1629928191 2021/08/25 21:49:51 $

General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
hero polymorphed into a vampire can use #monster to shape-shift rather than
	just do a one-shot polymorph into bat/cloud/wolf and shifted vampire
	hero can use #monster again to take on another form (randomly chosen
	among the shiftable shapes and true vampire form)
adjust bones filename buffer sizes to accommodate suffix
fix internal self-recover to work with recent fields added to checkpoint file
improvements to pronoun usage when hallucinating
function calls made from map_glyphinfo() based on dungeon level are now called
	once per level
fast hero could have random clairvoyance happen more than once on same turn
using 'Q' on wielded weapon would offer to split stack; make using 'w' on a
	quivered stack behave similarly
weight for giant spider was too low for creature of size 'large';
	weight for giant beetle was much too low for 'large'
leave some menu items out of "invert all" via '@' when their inclusion would
	degrade the usefulness of that interface feature
change crysknife from mineral to bone and worm tooth from unspecified to bone
worn meat ring shouldn't cause increased hunger; neither should fake Amulet
worn +0 ring of protection should cause increased hunger if it is the only
	source of extrinsic Protection
monster wielding Stormbringer or healer's Staff against another monster would
	heal the hero instead of the wielding monster when draining life
change twoweapon feedback from "not a weapon" to "not a suitable weapon"
don't allow twoweapon combat if either weapon is a bow, crossbow, or sling
	[later: or arrows, bolts, and missiles (darts, shuriken, boomerangs)]
drum of earthquake feedback reported various things (fountains, thrones, &c)
	falling into a chasm but they remained intact because trap creation
	had been changed to not clobber such things (so couldn't make pits)
make earthquake which hits a secret door or a secret corridor reveal it
wizard mode wishing for "Amulet of Yendor" had 50:50 chance for true Amulet
	or a cheap plastic imitation; recognize "real Amulet of Yendor" and
	"fake Amulet of Yendor" to precisely specify either of them but also
	take away the 50% chance of yielding a fake one when neither real nor
	fake is specified
unpaid globs showed weight info unconditionally outside of wizmode
walking out of tethered-to-buried-object trap condition was supposed to
	reinstate punishment but wasn't finding the buried iron ball because
	the trap condition was cleared first to indicate escape; result was
	attached chain that got dragged around but had no ball attached
when poly'd into a giant and moving onto a boulder's spot, message given was
	confused about whether autopickup would occur so could be misleading
random role selection wasn't honoring unwanted alignment(s) properly
if at the edge of the map window, trying to move farther fails but used a turn
hero can no longer wear blindfold/towel/lenses when poly'd into headless form
revamp achievement tracking for exploring Mine's End and Sokoban (by acquiring
	luckstone and bag of holding or amulet of reflection, respectively)
throttle long worm growth rate and HP accumulation
poly'd hero was able to zap wands, apply tools, and #rub objects without
	having any hands
spellcasting monster got an extra move after casting
allow defining #wizgenesis quantity in the prompt
digging through iron bars from an adjacent pit made a pit on top of the bars
give feedback if controlled level teleport attempt fails because hero is
	already on the bottom level and player tries to go even deeper
unseen pet that drowned didn't give "you have a sad feeling" message
prevent ravens from blinding other ravens: /corvus oculum corvi non eruit/
have ^X provide more information when held or swallowed
display wasn't updating immediately after toggling hilite_pet option
randomly choosing role could lead to crash via segfault
if eel bite attack caused hero to move (killed + rehumanized + crawled out
	of water), its grab attack could succeed even if no longer adjacent
specifying a count when picking [part of] a stack of scrolls of scare monster
	ignored that count and the whole stack was affected
wizmakemap didn't account for unique monsters and didn't correct monster
	birth counts
generate objects (eg. statues) with genocided or extinct monster classes
	in special levels, if requested
if the orc-town version of mine town has been loaded, creation of orc zombies
	or orc mummies would name them as part of the town raiding orc clan
when punished, involuntarily teleporting and landing within chain range of
	attached ball while encumbered worse than burdened could trigger
	"remove_object: obj not on floor" panic on hero's next move
update persistent inventory when 'menu_headings' or 'sortloot' options change
update persistent inventory when putting on a helmet causes it to auto-curse
inventory cursing caused by "this water's no good" effect when drinking from
	a fountain didn't update persistent inventory window
leashing or unleashing pets wasn't updating persistent inventory window
when the wetness of a towel in inventory changed, persistent inventory wasn't
	updated to show that
using wizard mode identify to ID 'all' updated perm_invent window but IDing
	specific items--even every one of them--did not
hold_another_object added item to inventory first, then maybe removed and
	dropped it, resulting in spurious add and remove perm_invent updates
when hold_another_object fails while hero is swallowed, drop the item into
	swallower's inventory instead of onto the floor
hold_another_object (for wishing, horn of plenty, theft while poly'd, other
	non-pickup actions giving hero another inventory item) wasn't
	reporting change in encumbrance; that would catch up on next turn but
	could be off during additional move(s) for current turn
hold_another_object used hardcoded Stressed to limit carrying instead of
	using the 'pickup_burden' option for that
transforming a potion by dipping a unicorn horn into it could result in the
	potion being dropped due to 'pickup_burden' if encumbrance was already
	over threshold before dipping but within it after removal from invent
fix priest created inside temple wall
fix vault guard occasionally encasing monsters in stone
tone down scare monster by excluding humans and uniques
lock the castle chest
revamp amnesia to forget skills instead of objects or maps
when Punished and carrying the iron ball and levitating, hurtling in the
	opposite direction of a thrown object didn't bring along the chain
recognize "kirin" as alias for "ki-rin" when asked to create a monster
make unique swallowing monsters (Juiblex) resist magical digging from inside
correctly account for fuel remaining when lit candles are attached
	to candelabrum (the previous code would make the game unwinnable if
	there were 15 or fewer turns remaining)
praying on an unaligned altar outside of Gehennom behaved like an ordinary
	prayer; make that always fail
tribute (Discworld snippets) typos, in book order rather than fix order:
	Sourcery passage #4 "the moment the words were out of your mouth" ->
	 "the moment and the words out of your mouth" where "were" didn't
	 belong and awkward phrasing because of it caused "and" to be removed
	 (would be much clearer if optional comma after "moment" was included)
	Moving Pictures passage #10 initial single quote should be double,
	 #12 "or" -> "of", #14 second instance of "megalomaniac" misspelled
	Lords and Ladies passage #5, near end add missing opening double
	 quote, passage #7 last paragraph, "to" -> "be"
	Men at Arms passage #1, italicize /for/, passage #2, insert omitted
	 word "had": 'it was /fate/ that _had_ let Edward'
	Interesting Times passage #1, italicize several words
	Feet of Clay passage #1, second "does not need" -> "doesn't even need"
	Hogfather passage #7 missing initial double quote for "Oh, just ...",
	 also #7 insert missing "you" into "Why are you feeling [...]"
	Soul Music passage #1, italicize /feel/, #8, "fossile" -> "fossil"
	Jingo passage #2 "Vines" -> "Vimes", "profferred" -> "proffered",
	 missing opening single quote on second sentence of Lord Downey's
	 line, passage #11 both in footnote:  "genious" -> "genius",
	 "was, oddly enough, was one [...]" -> "was, oddly enough, one [...]"
	The Fifth Elephant #1, italicize /always/, #9, "dublet" -> "doublet"
	The Truth #1, italicize several words
	Thief of Time #2, "gold starts" -> "gold stars"
	A Hat Full of Sky passage #9 "though" -> "thought"
	various, including Death quotes:  use two spaces to separate sentences
unicorn corpses and wraith corpses could be sacrificed even if "too old"
hero polymorphed into a hider and hiding was not unhidden when teleporting
impose tighter restraints on 'summon nasties', both for spellcasting monsters
	and post-Wizard harassment
prevent swallowing monster ending up in a solid wall if it killed vault guard
fix attached ball getting deallocated if swallowed, going down into a pit,
	and saving
level compiler creates correct novel with supplied name
for farlook, describe water in the castle moat and in Juiblex's swamp as moat
	and as swamp, respectively, rather than just as "water"
make hezrous emit poison clouds when they move
stepping from one type of terrain to another was triggering an unnecessary
	status update
make shriekers summon baby purple worms if purple worms would be too tough
make non-tame (baby) purple worms eat corpses off the ground
make baby purple worms attack shriekers
make hero polymorphed into baby purple worm warned against shriekers
confused scroll of light summons tame cancelled lights
potions of hallucination can give enlightenment
add a small chance of surviving food poisoning
deliberate level teleporter activation ignores magic resistance
auto-id scroll of remove curse when a known buc-state was changed
demon lords hate Demonbane
pets avoid eating shapeshifter corpses unless starving or nearly feral
blessed scroll of teleportation gives a single controlled teleport
allow opening a tin without interruption if slimed
tell player when wielding a different weapon toggles off dual-wielding
object taking erosion damage might give feedback message when out of view
	or not give such when in view, depending on stale value of 'bhitpos'
	[cited case assumed message came from drowned monster's dropped
	inventory when out-of-view ice melted]
it's possible to wish for tins of the Riders in wizard mode; eating one is
	fatal but if you're life-saved or decline to die, the game crashed
revival via undead turning of corpse carried by hero said "your <mon> corpse
	comes alive" even when revived monster was undead
prevent searching or waiting next to a hostile monster if boolean option
	safe_wait is on - override with 'm'
allow random mimics to show up mimicing more furniture than just stairs
scatter exploding bag of holding contents instead of outright deleting them
male hero poly'd into nymph chooses charm vs seduce message based on being
	male rather than on all nymphs being female but charm message was
	using hardcoded pronouns She,her for target monster--wrong for male
	target and noticable if "<mon> finishes taking off his suit" is given
hostile monsters with a ranged attack try to stay away from melee range
allow displacing peaceful creatures
unicorn horns don't restore attribute loss anymore
when a shop is changed from food to health food, change room type to match
wish parsing of things containing monster names would accept all supported
	alternate spellings if they occurred at the end ("corpse of mumakil")
	but only some when they occurred elsewhere ("gray-elf corpse" worked,
	"mumakil corpse" yielded "does not exist") depending upon name length
couldn't wish for werecreature corpse or tin because monster name lookup
	always matched the beast form which is flagged no-corpse; switch to
	human form for "were<creature>"
wishing for werecreature figurine always made one that created the monster in
	beast form if activated; allow "human were<creature>" to explicitly
	specify werecreature's human form (for corpses and tins as well as
	figurines); override the restriction against human figurines for that
wishing for "royal jelly" yielded "lump of royal jelly" as a special case, but
	other 'of' items such as "clove of garlic", "sprig of wolfsbane", or
	"piece of cloth" didn't allow using their post-of words as shorthand
monster or object detection found semi-dead vault guard at <0,0> while
	traversing fmon list; monster detection gave misleading feedback
	(blank map instead of 'strange feeling') if there were no other
	monsters on level; likewise object detection and guard's minvent
squadprob[] in mkroom.c was defined with 5 elements but initialized only 4
	resulting in giant ants sometimes
allow nurses heal attack when wielding a non-weapon/weaptool
if riding or levitating, hero could apply bullwhip downward to pull up things
	from underwater or lava; feedback implied the item was on the surface
some monster code was checking whether pets or engulfers were eating green
	slime by checking for green slime corpse instead of glob
change light radius of stack of candles to square root
could get redundate "mon hits other-mon" messages when mon wields an artifact
failed untrap while mounted that moved hero onto the trap would leave steed
	with stale coordinates, triggering warnings if 'sanity_check' is On
when digging a pit results in it being filled by adjacent pool or lava, any
	objects at the spot weren't subjected to water or fire damage;
	also, riding hero's steed wasn't subjected to immersion either
after "double trouble", cloned Wizard would wait until he had suffered some
	damage or hero moved into direct view; keep STRAT_WAIT for original
	Wizard but avoid that for clones
beyond turn 100000, prayer timeout is longer (scaling with game length)
falling while going down stairs and dropping items due to encumbrance or
	punishment wasn't subjecting fragile ones to breakage
objects scattered by an explosion which land on water or lava weren't affected
	by the water or lava
change mkclass() to usually honor (always honor for L class) the hell-only and
	never-in-hell monster creation flags; no more achi-lich in the Castle
	(nor master lich there unless demilich gets a potion of gain level)
thieving monster could be killed while hero was removing armor, triggering
	warning "stealarm(): dead monster stealing" when taking-off finished
petrifying a long worm and then reanimating it handled tail incorrectly;
	with sanity_check On, X coordinate of head segment was reported as 0
attempting to read a novel while blind reported "you can't read the mystic
	runes" like for a spellbook; use "you can't read the words" for novel
don't let life draining reduce a monster's max HP below its level + 1
report "<Mon> expires" rather than "<Mon> dies" if polymorphed hero kills a
	non-living monster (golem, vortex) with life drain (vampire bite)
allow hero in silver-hating form to ring the silver bell but only if on/over
	the vibrating square
reading the Book of the Dead while blind is allowed; doing so gives
	"you turn the pages of the Book of the Dead" and the type of item
	becomes discovered, but the object wasn't being flagged as 'dknown'
	so if not seen yet it remained "a spellbook" in hero's inventory
reading cursed Book of the Dead while blind gave feedback for sighted hero
reading non-cursed Book of the Dead after prepping with the other tools gave
	a message referring to those as "artifacts" if either of them were
	cursed; those unique items aren't artifacts so use "relics" instead
zapping a line of boulders with striking or force bolt was updating 'couldsee'
	but deferring 'cansee', resulting in seeing the first boulder fracture
	and only hearing that happen for the others despite coming into view
the default engraving, epitaph, and bogus monster inserted by 'makedefs -s'
	(3.6.6 fix for empty source data file) lacked terminating newline, so
	when the corresponding file wasn't actually empty its first line ended
	up concatenated; default portion of the bad combined entry would be
	decrypted properly but the portion from the file's first line wouldn't
if the Wizard of Yendor fled up the stairs on level 1, the game would behave
	as if he was still in play, but he wouldn't be on migrating monsters
	list so couldn't be brought back and wouldn't appear on Plane of Earth
	(stale non-zero value for context.no_of_wizards)
if a mind flayer's psychic blast targetted a hidden monster, feedback named
	the monster but it wasn't brought out of hiding
hero poly'd into a mind flayer who used #monster to emit a psychic blast was
	able to harm mindless monsters with it
some hero attacks that should have gotten a skill bonus or penalty didn't
change internal name of "<foo> venom" to "splash of <foo> venom"
some operations that made sense to handle venom ('D', scroll of identify, no
	doubt others) ignored it because venom is suppressed from packorder;
	matters for wizard mode or for normal play that loads wizard bones
singularize "splashes" to "splash" instead of "splashe"
treat slinging gems and tossing or slinging stones at unicorns as attacks
give rot-away timer instead of revive timer to corpses of cancelled trolls
switch revive timer to rot-away timer if a troll corpse gets cancelled
uncancel an ice troll if its corpse is put into an ice box; give corpse a
	revive timer if later taken out
splitting a stack of candy bars gave new wrapper text depending upon the
	obj->o_id value assigned; keep existing text for both halves of stack
	(side-effect: separate candy bars usually won't merge anymore)
describing tin variety (deep fried, pureed, &c) relied on the 'contents known'
	flag but object identification wasn't setting obj->cknown for tins
wizard mode #wizintrinsic: setting Levitation wouldn't block Flying as
	intended because the check for that was being made too soon
chatting to the quest leader in wizard mode with sufficient experience level
	and insufficient piety, player is asked whether alignment should be
	boosted; answering 'n' resulted in being prompted a second time
end of game inventory disclosure passed an inappropriate argument to the
	inventory display routine; not noticeable for tty and curses,
	noticeable but not harmful for X11, and slightly harmful for Qt
turning into slime rendered hero as slime one turn too soon
avoid potential infinite loop if hangup occurs at ring "right or left?" prompt
randomize the turns where accessories and extrinsics affect nutrition
handle being interrupted by approaching monsters more consistently
if hero attacked a peaceful monster, some other peaceful monsters with humanoid
	shape (minotaur, zruty, perhaps others) that witnessed it but which
	shouldn't be capable of normal speech expressed their surprise audibly
make gasp/exclamation message from peaceful monsters be more verbose to
	indicate which monster is doing the gasping or exclaiming
when make was invoked with -j makedefs instances could end up running in
	parallel and could trample on each other's temp files; default to
	using mkstemp(); allow a port runtime library implementation that lacks
	mkstemp() to define HAS_NO_MKSTEMP to revert to the old behaviour;
	provide a work-alike mkstemp() implementation for windows visual studio
	in mdlib.c so there is no requirement to define HAS_NO_MKSTEMP there
make piranhas faster and give them extra bite attack
fire sources can ignite candles, lamps, and potions of oil
for multiple drop ('D') with menustyle traditional or combination, if the only
	object class player picked was '$' then it operated on all classes
small monsters could seep through their shirt
don't snuff brass lantern when it's hit by water unless it is submerged
when reporting that hero can't repair a chest's broken lock with key/pick/card
	just describe the base item without BUC, user assigned name, &c since
	"You can't repair a chest's lock with an uncursed key." implicitly
	suggests that you might be able to do so with a blessed or cursed one
pre-populate teleport destination prompt with travel destination
ghosts cannot be renamed
tossed upwards objects got two times half physical damage reduction
monster xorns could pass through iron bars but not eat them; monster rock
	moles could no neither; now they can eat bars when adjacent and will
	do so if the bars are blocking their path
hero poly'd into rust monster could implicitly eat bars when adjacent by
	trying to move there, now when in rock mole form too; in xorn form
	can explicitly eat them via 'e' after moving onto their spot
monster hiding under an egg that hatched was kept hidden
restful sleep regenerates hit points
attacking non-adjacent concealed mimic by applying a polearm would make the
	hero be stuck to that mimic
hero could break a wand ("raising the wand high over your head, you break it
	in two") even if hands were welded to a two-handed weapon or to a
	one-handed weapon and also to a shield
if a monster threw a cocktrice egg at the hero but hit and petrified another
	monster, the hero would get credit/blame for killing it
since ki-rin look quite a bit like unicorns, make them be more like one:
	allow them to use their own horn to cure themselves; remove M1_ANIMAL,
	change MS_NEIGH to MS_SPELL, add MR_POISON, use horse body parts;
	they're still 'A' rather than 'u' and don't care about gems
wand/scroll of create monster or bag of tricks that makes a new monster which
	can be seen or sensed becomes discovered, but was doing so even for a
	concealed mimic seen as furniture or an object
'showscore' could be used to determine how much gold was inside a container
	whose contents were unknown
wizard mode (only way to get timed flying): if levitation and flying time out
	on same turn, player was told "You have stopped levitating and are
	now flying."; status line wasn't updated to remove stale Fly condition
throwing or kicking a shop container (that's light enough to move) made the
	hero pay for any gold inside, then didn't refund that amount if the
	container landed inside the shop
try to fix message sequencing for tame golems that "roast/rot/rust in peace"
autodescribe when moving the cursor was erroneously honoring MSGTYPE=stop
	and potentially delivering sounds
reduce the number of "seeXYZ" commands by renaming some: #seenv -> #wizseenv,
	#seegold -> #showgold, #seespells -> #showspells, #seetrap -> #showtrap
when saving while punished or game ends while punished, handling for ball and
	chain might access freed memory with unpredictable consequences
brown pudding monster hitting another monster with decay attack corroded armor
	instead of rotting it
<?> -> <full key bindings> omitted 'n' prefix and M-digit for number_pad mode,
	and ^A/re-do was suppressed due lack of obsolete '#define REDO'
add missing key binding support for rush.numpad; default is M-5 for numpad==1
	or plain 5 for numpad==2 where behavior of 5 and M-5 are swapped
allow monsters to use wand of undead turning to revive corpses on floor
	in some situations
selling a container to a shop for gold leaves any contents that the shop
	doesn't ordinarily buy and sell owned by the hero, but selling the
	container for credit resulted in the shop taking poesession of such
	contents without giving any additional credit; mark out of place
	contents 'no_charge' so that hero can reclaim them without buying
add some new demonic and angelic maledictions
when fire damage dried a wet towel, it would never reduce the wetness to 0
when water damage wet a towel, the new wetness might randomly become less
make Death revive earlier, and all the Riders after 67 turns at latest
when protection from shape changers begins, force mimic out of concealment
	even if hero can't see its location; for locations that can be seen,
	don't make double-trouble Wizard concealed as another monster--or pet
	temporarily mimicking something while eating mimic corpse--fall asleep
best possible armor class reduced from -127 to -99; worst from +127 to +99;
	charged or enchanted individual items also capped at +/- 99 (affects
	wizard mode wishing, negligible effect on normal play)
fix several inconsistencies for objects at hole locations
make repeat (^A) work when bound to some other keystroke
if a prefix key was bound to some character which ordinarily ran a regular
	command and that command wasn't bound to another key, typing the
	prefix followed by a non-movement key behaved strangely:  instead
	of reporting "invalid direction" it would run the other command
	(actually depended upon relative order of prefix's new and old key)
reqmenu (the request-a-menu prefix supported by a handful of non-movement
	commands) could be bound to some key other than 'm' but it only
	worked if the new key was also a movement prefix
when telepathically sensed pet ate a mimic corpse and temporarily took on
	a different shape, you were told that you sensed it changing into
	something but the map continued to show its true shape (telepathy
	overrides mimic hiding); give a different message in that case
when a pet ate a mimic corpse and tried to temporarily look like a sink it
	ended up looking like a throne (terrain type SINK == symbol S_throne)
have dowhatdoes ('&') catch up with '?i' to describe ^A, ESC, and movement
	prefix keystrokes correctly instead of reporting "no such command"
give barrow wights a cold touch
for configuration using external compression on save files that applied a name
	suffix, 'selectsaved' (restore via menu) couldn't handle any which had
	been manually uncompressed, mangling file name trying to remove suffix
an empty lamp hit by fire reported "the oil lamp catches fire" (but at least
	didn't light)
spells that require a target spot rather than a direction (like skilled
	fireball) would not let a blinded hero target his/her own spot, with
	feedback stating hero failed to hold location sufficiently in mind;
	when not blind, such spells left autodescribe feedback for target spot
	in the message window while the spell was being performed
prevent wish request "death wand" from matching Death monster and producing a
	random wand instead of a wand of death
grammar bit: "you hear a [AEF] note squeak in the distance" (should be "an")
curses interface failed to honor menu_xxx option settings for menu interaction
during engraving, spaces were counted instead of non-spaces [later: affected
	code is gone, removed when engraving was converted into an occupation]
when an explosion scatters objects, make any that fly over sinks stop there
output message when changing fastmove mode while cursor targetting
messages when Minetown watchmen become angry could report "you see an angry
	guard approaching" even if he was invisible and hero can't see invis
when autopickup is on but disabled due to being inside a shop, have ^X say so
don't force fake player monks to always be male
it was theoretically possible to overflow an internal buffer containing
	inventory letters by carrying more than 52 separate lit candles and
	using the '(' or '*' commands
hero would be blinded and stunned by an Archon's radiance (gaze attack) even
	if the Archon was blind, but monsters would not
applying a polearm to attempt to attack a hidden monster would report "wait!
	there's a monster hidden there" and display the "remembered, unseen
	monster" glyph but only use a turn if polearm wasn't already wielded
key parsing during options processing was inconsistent between OPTIONS=foo:k
	BINDINGS=k:foo where k represents a key designation; the OPTIONS form
	recognized backslash escape sequences but not M-x meta characters,
	vice versa for BINDINGS (most noticeable for menu interaction keys
	such as menu_next_page because those can be set via either directive)
when creating a rolling boulder trap, don't place boulder on a path that
	starts on or passes over a pit/spiked pit, hole/trap door,
	teleport trap/level teleporter/magic portal
remove superfluous "All" from "All foos are already nonexistent." when blessed
	genocide tries to remove something which has already been genocided
"#dip <item> into -" produced a scrambled message:
	You mime dip <item> intoing something.
similarly, "#rub the royal jelly on -" produced
	You mime rub the royal jellying on something.
mounted hero falling out of saddle shouldn't hit ground and take damage when
	levitating or flying (if done without steed's help)
avoid "obj not free" panic if monster kills itself by reading scroll of earth
attempting to throw a partial stack of gold at self was prevented but left
	the partial stack in an extra $ inventory slot
quivering a partial stack of gold succeeded and put the partial stack in an
	extra $ inventory slot
if player managed to get multiple $ items, all but the last could be moved to
	normal letter slots via #adjust and then subsequent #adjust with a
	count could split them into even more slots
when a monster on the far side of a closed door opens it, sometimes the hero
	was told about the monster without it being displayed on the map
also show extended command name when showing what a key does in help
poly'd hero who exploded when attacking a monster didn't wake up other
	monsters in the vicinity; when attacking thin air, hero's explosion
	woke other monsters within different radius than same monster's would
troll corpse revival was inhibited by hero wielding Trollsbane; change that
	to being killed by Trollsbane instead (wielded by hero or by monster)
statues representing petrified creatures on Medusa's level might be from
	monsters who change form (golems) when hit with stoning damage
attempt to make corpse or statue of a named player character would yield that
	of a random monster instead when 'record' was empty; could result in
	statues of non-stonable creatures in cockatrice nests
homemade tin of very low nutrition corpse gave more nutrition than the corpse
magic mapping performed while engulfed or underwater would display whole map
	but then not switch back to the engulfed or underwater restricted view
#overview used hardcoded bold and inverse for highlighting; switch to the
	'menu_headings' option value so player has some control
for menustyle:full, the 'A' menu choice to auto-select everything now only
	does so if no other choices have been picked; when any have (object
	class or BUCX state or both), it auto-selects every item that matches
	those choices (so still skips the second menu) rather than every item
using travel to move one step diagonally where that step was blocked by being
	too narrow to squeeze through stopped travel instead of considering
	alternate routes to the destination
turn off input autocompletion for '#twoweapon' since simple 'X' invokes it;
	likewise for #wizdetect (^E), #wizgenesis (^G), #wizidentify (^I),
	#wizlevelport (^V), #wizmap (^F), and #wizwish (^W); probably ought
	to do so for #overview (^O) too but that one still autocompletes
if a branch has only one level (Fort Ludios), prevent creation of any level
	teleporters there (level definition doesn't have any but wizard mode
	wishing could attempt to place one)
opening/unlocking magic zapped at monster holding the hero will release hold
	(zap at engulfer already expels hero); zapping at self has same effect
when riding, allow scroll of remove curse read by hero to affect steed's saddle
the 'scores' option for final top ten display left default values in place if
	only some of the three settings were set; 'scores:own' should have
	produced '0 top/0 around/own' but ended up as '3 top/2 around/own'
allow 'scores:none' as shorthand for 'scores:0 t/0 a/!o' (player will be told
	whether new score made the list but no scores will be shown)
contents of chests, large boxes, and ice boxes are now immune to water damage
	unless the container is cursed, same as for oilskin sacks (previously,
	chests+large boxes were always immune and ice boxes always vulnerable)
applying an empty brass lantern in an attempt to light it reported "your lamp
	has run out of power"; change to "your lantern is out of power"
when swallowed or underwater, player could be told about events (such as a
	shapechanger taking on a new form) that the hero sensed but which
	were not shown on the screen; treat being swallowed or underwater as
	situations which block telepathy, extended monster detection, warning
some rolling boulder trap feedback was inconsistent
change "killed by <a foo>, while {paralyzed|frozen} by <a foo>" into
	"killed by <a foo>, while {paralyzed|frozen}" if the killer caused
	hero's helplessness
"It looks very angry" would be given if a hero wielding Excalibur or Demonbane
	offended an unseen demon lord
Entering a special room, only wake up the monsters in that room instead of
	doing a level-wide wake-up
any blessed key was behaving as if was the rogue's Master Key when unlocking
	a trapped chest or box
when an unseen non-pet picks up or uses an item, hero loses known/dknown/
	bknown/cknown/lknown memory of that item (so becomes unidentified; in
	particular, player won't be asked what to call unseen thrown potion)
wishing for a partly eaten wraith corpse yielded "partly eaten food (1) more
	nutritious than untouched food (0)"
if PREFIXES_IN_USE was defined (and VAR_PLAYGROUND forces it to be) when
	COMPRESS was also defined (external save and bones file compression
	via fork()+exec()), the file name buffer in docompress_file() wasn't
	big enough so could overflow and trigger a crash
suppress "This <foo> corpse takes {delicious|okay|terrible}" if preceded by
	"You have a bad case of stomach acid" or "Ecch - that must have been
	poisonous"
innocuous items like scrolls or eucalyptus leaves did harm when falling on
	hero's head after being thrown upward
fighter types who start out knowing all non-magic armor should not know
	cornuthaum and dunce cap
prediscovered weapons adjustmens:  only knights and samurai know polearms;
	rangers know launchers (bows), ammo (arrows), and spears regardless
	of their race/species; likewise, rogues know all daggers
if the move counter ever reaches 1000000000, end the game
knights get no metal armor penalty for clerical spells
change touch of death from instadeath to maxhp reduction and damage
dying from being level-drained below level 1 killed hero without saying so
	and jumped straight to "do you want your possessions identified?"
conflict will now consider your charisma and requires line of sight
boost hit points of some golems
make anti-magic fields drain more energy and prevent them from showing up
	too early in the dungeon
eating magical monsters such as wizards or shamans may give a mild buzz
make exploding spheres create an actual explosion
pets are more careful about attacking monsters at low health
allow killing your quest leader to open the quest
give King Arthur Excalibur
when moving the cursor to examine the map, have '^' move to next trap even if
	that trap is displayed with some other symbol (web, vibrating square)
change valkyrie and warrior (valk quest) monsters from chaotic to lawful
change attendant (healer quest) monster from lawful to neutral
quit is not longer bound to M-q
change default value of autopickup to off and color to on
resurrected corpse of mon could end up with different gender from original mon
using a bullwhip to snatch a wielded cockatrice corpse from a monster when not
	wearing gloves and without life-saving could trigger "obj_is_local"
	panic during final cleanup
make fire-command autowield an appropriate launcher and add fireassist boolean
	option to toggle the assistance off
Angels and priests were always described as "the {Angel,priest,high priest} of
	<deity>" when first two should have been "{an Angel,a priest}..."
shopkeepers can remove pits and webs
perm_invent: when buying shop goods using itemized purchasing while persistent
	inventory window was enabled, the prices of unpaid items went away as
	soon as any item was bought (actual item-by-item purchase worked ok)
change getloc fastmove keys in number_pad mode from hardcoded HJKL to the
	run/rush movement keys (meta+number)
allow using rush/run prefix key in getloc to fastmove the cursor
avoid "it" in messages "Wait!  There's an it hiding under <an object>!" (hero
	moving) and "It was hidden under <an object>!" (unseen monster moving)
don't extinguish burning objects when engulfed by a fire vortex
allow wishing for a novel via description "paperback book" (previously only
	worked when specifying "paperback spellbook")
deal with gold leaving a shop via scatter()
defer encumbrance check during polymorph to new man; newman() -> redist_attr()
	-> encumber_msg() could report change in encumbrance that immediately
	became obsolete if polyman() subsequently restored old attributes
fix heap-use-after-free when attacking monster with potion
for "a" vs "an", add ukulele and uke as exceptions for "an u<anything>"
add new extended command #retravel
remove special doinv key, functionality was equal to BIND=0:inventory
some monsters should not have been scared of bugle playing
monsters that drowned would never leave a corpse (holdover from decades ago
	when it wasn't possible to recover anything from a water location)
give alternate message if hero is blind when throne gives "your vision clears"
monster wearing an alchemy smock was only getting poison resistance from it,
	not acid resistance; give both properties, just like for hero
in wizard mode, knowing teleport away spell resulted in ^T always attempting
	the spell instead of teleporting on demand
describe a couple of isolated moat spots on Samurai quest home level as water
	rather than as moat
crawling out of water to avoid drowning didn't work as intended when trying
	to move diagonally through a tight squeeze
in wizard mode, polymorphing into hero's role monster in order to revert to
	normal form would complain about missing light source if hero was
	changing back from the form of a light-emitting monster [didn't affect
	normal play because role monsters are invalid polymorph targets there]
revise a 3.6.1 fix: if a spellbook which is being read becomes cursed, always
	stop reading: "The <book> slams shut!" and set book->bknown
concealed mimic could trigger sanity check warning "mimic concealed as an
	object despite Prot-from-shape-changers" if hidden as "strange object"
cancelled shape changer would become uncancelled if saved and restored (even
	just leaving its level and then returning)
don't include time spent suspended in background (^Z) or in shell escape (!)
	in the total elapsed time recorded to xlogfile
if a monster is starting to turn into green slime, eat the corpse, tin, or
	egg of any creature that might polymorph into a fiery monster to cure
	the slime, not just of one of a chameleon
yet another fix for display problems during restore:  if game is saved while
	hero is hallucinating but that's suppressed because of wielding
	Grayswandir, hero is riding, and the steed is on or over an object,
	restore will try to update hero's spot when making sure objects aren't
	being obfuscated by hallucination, but when displaying the hero there
	instead it would access steed pointer before that has been set up
resistances gained from worn or wielded items also protect hero's inventory
non-metallic gloves protect worn rings from shock


Fixes to 3.7.0-x Problems that Were Exposed Via git Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------
fix compile when DLB isn't defined
urealtime.realtime was being incorrectly calculated
revised "mysterious force" when climbing out of gehennom could generate
	warnings about "rn2(0) attempted" or "rn2(-n) attempted"
after 'w' on split stack patch, wielding '-' would cause an object_lost panic
same patch allowed partial stack from getobj to replace cursed wielded weapon
autounlock of door or chest took no time; chest case depended on whether
	anything got looted along with the unlocking
autounlock with artifact unlocking tool didn't do touch check on that tool
autounlock picked Rogue's artifact key over lock-pick or credit card (or
	ordinary key depending upon invent order) even for non-rogues who
	would be blasted when touching it
wielded aklys had its "(tethered weapon...)" description scrambled
randomized trap name could pick trap #0 which isn't a trap and yielded "water"
if running and Blind or Stunned or Fumbling or Dex < 10, encountering a closed
	door orthogonally would keep reporting "ouch! you bump into a door"
	repeatedly until eventually interrupted by approaching monster or
	hunger or ^C
data.base lookup of an entry with any blank lines would falsely claim that
	"'data' file in wrong fromat or corrupted" after some extra checks
	were added while investigating tab handling anomalies
using nhl_error() to report a Lua processing problem would clobber the stack
level teleporation's "You materialize on a different level!" could be given
	out of sequence with other arrival messages
more sequencing: if wielding Sting or similar and level teleporting to a
	level with different warning effect, the start-glowing or stop-glowing
	message came before the materialize message on the destination level
prevent "you materialize on a different level" after "a mysterious force
	prevents you from descending" if you try to level teleport past the
	stairs down from the quest home level before being granted access
creating Mine Town variant 1 (Orcish Town) sometimes complained about being
	unable to place lregion type 1 and failed to have any staircase up
set g.context.botl for glove and wielding actions that could start or end
	bare-handedness in support of condtests[bl_bareh]
reinstate ranked ordering of the status condition fields
grammar for messages about a monster removing items from a container was bad
some new status conditions didn't always update when they should
fix flipping non-existent stairs and ladders (github #311)
fix door created into random wall or position opening into solid wall
handle gone portal when going back in quest
'use_inverse' option was accidentally made Windows-only; change it back to
	being more general; change its default to True
change inconsistent achievement spelling of "Mine Town" to "Minetown"
fix crash in water_damage_chain
teleport feedback "you materialize at another location" was given too soon
'mention_decore' was repeatedly reporting "you are back on bottom" when
	moving around underwater
revised 'mention_decor' was describing furniture or ice right before look-here
	described the same thing when stepping onto object(s)
poison gas clouds located over known but unlit pools were visible as known
	clouds but steam clouds in that situation were not
after the wish parsing change, wishing for "<something of monster>" or for
	"<monster something>" worked as intended but wishing for "<monster>"
	(where <monster> used the canonical spelling) triggered a crash
fix new "objects[0] class #1 not in order!" panic if plain 'char' is unsigned
only generate shop items on solid floor squares
avoid gcc 10 warning by removing duplicate definition of 'head_engr'
if a monster removed a corpse from an ice box, the corpse would never rot away
monster creation on quest levels could make genocided creatures
enabling wizard mode 'sanity_check' option would complain about invalid mhpmax
	value for level N monsters created with a d8 value of 1 for all N d8's
disable that extra check because gremlim HP split after cloning triggers it
some versions of tiles processing (not X11's) complained about the rename of
	"{acid,blinding} venom" to "splash of {acid,blinding} venom"
wizard mode #timeout changed to show timed Displacement in 'can be timed in
	normal play' section instead of 'timed via #wizintrinsic only' section
the fix to make worm visibility checks work as intended forced the coordinates
	of the extra tail segment co-located with the worm monster to match
	the worm instead of leaving it off the map; place_worm_tail_randomly()
	reverses the segments and can throw some away if there isn't room,
	but throwing away the extra segment removed the worm from the map
using 'O' to try to change 'symset' was a no-op; 'roguesymset' worked
change default for lit attribute in special level des.terrain directives to
	'unchanged' instead of 'unlit'
replace worm tail placement code that reportedly led to a sanity_check warning
	[no actual code problem found; might be compiler bug for 'xchar']
learn scroll of teleportation after reading even when random destination is
	right by starting spot
fix off-by-one bug in dimensions of theme rooms
fire/frost horn feedback when zapped by monster was inaccurate (falsely
	claimed that it was "directed at self" when attacking hero)
tins of spinach and 'dead' eggs could cause out of array bounds access
	attempting to index into mons[] by polyfodder() macro
options help ('? g') listed all boolean options, then repeated them among
	the compound options; on OSX they showed a description of "(null)"
	but for other sprintf implementations they might cause a crash
change name of #wizlevelflip to #wizfliplevel
dwarves could sometimes pass through walls without digging their way
fix genetic engineers dropping Schroedinger's cat box
the checks and handling for fountains, sinks, and drawbridges were being
	missed during liquid_flow
monster movement flags unification allowed displacer beasts to displace Riders
a long worm with no visible segments (but one internal segment) might trigger
	warning: tail 'segement' at <0,some_y>, worm at <mx,my> if teleported
adding displacer beast inadvertently introduced a regression in swapping with
	pets, allowing them to be pulled into water by hero on/over water
splitting #if MAIL into #if MAIL_STRUCTURES and #if MAIL made it possible to
	wish for and write scrolls of mail with MAIL disabled, but attempting
	to read such a scroll issued impossible "What weird effect is this?"
remove M2_MALE flag that was unintentionally left on dwarf lord/lady/leader
	entry and was preventing female incarnations
tilemap.c wasn't building if STATUES_LOOK_LIKE_MONSTERS wasn't defined; also,
	to match the code that should be defined so change the preprocessor
	test to 'ifndef STATUES_DONT_LOOK_LIKE_MONSTERS'
ensure that monster female name variation ends up as a female during ^G
arbitrate when there is a conflict between gender term (male or female) and
	a gender-tied monster name (cavewoman) during ^G; gender term wins
wizard mode sanity check complained about Wizard's clone mimicking a monster
new ^G gender-naming handling code required a guard against null permonst
	pointer which could occur under some circumstances
replace "aligned priest" entries in Pri-loca.lua, astral.lua, minetn-1.lua,
	and sanctum.lua, with "aligned cleric"
attempting to swap places with a peaceful monster might cause it to flee
gender-specific monster names can be used in .lua files with the gender upheld
remove unused vision tables
changes accompanying sorting of discoveries resulted in omitting very last
	item for '`'/#knownclass on a class where every item was discoverable
	and had no extra labels (so potions and rings, possibly others, but
	not scrolls or wands) and every item was actually discovered
change to can_reach_floor() resulted in hero being unable to reach the floor
	when held by a lichen
panic if lua init fails
change wizard mode command #wizmgender to wizard mode option 'wizmgender'
engraving with non-blade dulled the weapon anyway (pr #464)
'sortdiscoveries:s' had a spurious generic header shown at the start of the
	last class if there were any artifacts or unique items discovered
loss of saddle by opening magic left hero mounted on unsaddled steed
avoid segfault during error reporting for bad 'O' value(s) after theme rooms
	have been initialized, leaving iflags.in_lua set
avoid complaints of "nothing to foo" for 'force_invmenu' if there are no
	likely candidates to foo with but there are hidden acceptable choices
avoid "Not carrying anything.  Never mind." for 'force_invmenu'
'altmeta' option could be toggled On but once On could not be toggled back Off
wearing a ring of protection and any amulet behaved as if wearing an amulet of
	guarding when determining MC value
messaging for genetic engineer attacks had several problems
give genetic engineers teleport capability (as they had in slash'em); 'port
	away after polymorphing someone so that they don't just repeat that
if an invisible hero managed to convert an unaligned altar to an aligned one
	with color enabled, altar wasn't immediately redrawn with new color
repair some regressions to (a)pply introduced by "getobj refactor" patch
getobj too: allow attempting to (E)ngrave with any item in inventory
fix ^X feedback when held typo: "unseen createure" -> "unseen creature"
if a <foo> corpse was set to revive as a <foo> zombie and corpse was partly
	eaten at revival time and monster <foo> is defined as providing more
	nutrition that <foo> zombie, oeaten_stat() could give the warning
	"partly eaten food more nutritious than untouched food" when used to
	calculate zombie's hit points (depended upon how much had been eaten)
undead turning magic revived corpses flagged as no-revive if they were being
	carried but not if they were zapped while on the floor
forgetting an item's known/dknown/bknown/&c settings when picked up by unseen
	monster made it possible to trigger a latent shop bug with globs;
	avoid clearing dknown flag for globs
fix globby_bill_fixup to use shopkeeper instead of Null for glob pricing
applying a book to check readability treated novels as if they were spellbooks
#version was leaving the 'in_lua' flag set and if subsequent 'O' issued an
	error (example was an attempt to interactively set bouldersym to an
	invalid value), the error reporting routine crashed via segfault
lighting for baalz level defaulted to random and could end up being lit
when using 'O' to set menu color patterns, the reminder message that the
	boolean menucolors option needs to be set to True for them to work
	was sometimes given even when already True
stair revamp unintentionally resulted in cursed potion of levitation no longer
	causing hero to hit head on ceiling
enlightenment/disclosure when wielding two weapons with two-weap skill higher
	than secondary weapon's skill had "with" duplicated in the feedback
corpse of monster with gender specific names (king vs queen and so forth)
	was always described by the neutral name (ruler and such)
prevent obj_pmname() from calling mon_pmname(monst) when monst->data is null
	to prevent a null pointer dereference
correct the pluralization of monarch to monarchs, rather than monarches
don't allow web spun by spider to interfere with solving Soloban
fix parsing of wish adjectives (return value broken by changes accompanying
	figurine gender patch)
when picking up a thrown weapon while quiver is empty, don't put it into the
	quiver slot if it needs to be wielded for throw-and-return action
using bhitpos in flooreffects to handle erosion damage broke its original use
	of tracking wand zaps if a teleportation zap hit an object; subsequent
	zap traversal was done from object's landing spot rather than from its
	zap hit spot, resulting in scrambled wand targetting
restore previous behavior of the 'altmeta' option (only wait for a second
	character when getting a command keystroke, not other key input)
baby gold dragons weren't able to grow into adult gold dragons
when hero is displaced, make monsters who try to stay out of direct line do so
	with spot where they think the hero is rather than where he really is
if hero died while wearing gold dragon scales/mail and left bones, they would
	still be emitting light witout being worn when bones got loaded
if an invisible monster put on or took off armor while out of hero's sight
	spurious message "Suddenly you cannot see it" would be given
an item thrown or dropped while swallowed was treated as being picked up by an
	unseen monster so object fields {known, dknown, bknown} got cleared
segfault if gremlin fled weaponless hero wearing gold dragon scales/mail
'disambiguate WHACK' patch affected field layout of objects[] but EDITLEVEL
	wasn't incremented, allowing incompatable save files to be restored

curses: 'msg_window' option wasn't functional for curses unless the binary
	also included tty support
curses: line input that doesn't take place on the bottom line of the message
	window uses a canned curses routine and doesn't support ESC to kill
	partial input or to cancel; "Who are you?" prompt was willing to name
	a character "^["; have the popup version of getlin() fake the usual
	ESC handling, but player has to type <escape><return> for that to work
curses: menu headings didn't use default text color
curses: #perminv changes disabled menu_headings attribute for persistent
	inventory window headings; reinstate that
Qt: at Xp levels above 20 with 'showexp' On, the combined status field
	"Level:NN/nnnnnnnn" was too big and truncated by a char at each end
Qt: searching a text window for something that wasn't found and then searching
	for some other target could crash
tty: redraw unexplored locations as S_unexplored rather than <space> after
	map has been partially overwritten by popup menu or text display
tty: previous change resulted in remnants of previous level being shown on
	new level after level change when S_unexplored is <space>
Unix: after lua changes to Makefiles, 'make spotless' for dat subdirectory
	left some generated data files which should have been deleted
Windows: new tile additions in win/share did not trigger the creation of a new
	NetHackW.res file
Windows: nhl_loadlua() was missing the RDBMODE argument on the [dlb_]fopen(),
	which is required on Windows to set binary mode; binary mode is
	required in order to be able to reliably navigate through a file using
	fseek(), ftell() and fread()
X11: was still initializing map to 'stone' instead of 'unexplored' after they
	became separate glyphs
X11: for text map without color, add support for black&white ice; draw it in
	inverse video to distinguish from ordinary floor
X11: if perm_invent is set in NETHACKOPTIONS or config file, start with the
	persistent inventory window displayed
X11: use visctrl(response) when X11_yn_function() echoes prompt+response in
	message window
X11: when trying to lookup scrollbars in order to handle scrolling via keys,
	menu handling always ended up finding the top window
X11: enable horizontal scrollbar for persistent inventory window
X11+OSX: after the "bad Atom" fix (below), the persistent inventory window
	crept downward every time it got updated


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes
-----------------------------------------
SYSCF: treat most sysconf directives that have invalid values as warnings
	rather than errors; use a conservative default value and continue
curses: for vertical status, line up conditions in columns; usually two but
	condense to three per line if the status window isn't tall enough
	[at present, highlighting with inverse video includes trailing spaces
	used to align entries in their columns--that's a feature...]
curses: indent items in perm_invent window by one space
curses: don't change the terminal's default colors
curses: remove unnecessary special handling for dark gray
curses: sometimes entering a count during menu selection caused the menu to
	disappear (example was apply/loot in-out container menu with two or
	more digits typed followed by non-digit); in-out menu was still active
	but no longer displayed
curses: support backspace/delete when entering a count during menu selection
macOS: Xcode project was failing to build if the path to the NetHack source
	tree contained a space; the issue was within some shell script code
	contained within the project
msdos: add -DSTATUES_LOOK_LIKE_MONSTERS to Makefile1.cross so the VESA mode
	can display statue glyphs
Qt: quit if can't load tiles file instead of continuing and then segfaulting
Qt: [later] tiles load failure at startup now continues using an ascii map
Qt: use more columns for extended command selection dialog so that the number
	of rows needed doesn't result in some commands being unaccessible
Qt: suppress wizard mode commands from '#' handling when not in wizard mode
Qt: organize extended command selection grid by columns instead of by rows
	(first N entries down left column, next N entries down 2nd column, &c)
Qt: when selecting an extended command by typing its name, support <delete>
	(aka <rubout>) in addition to <backspace> to go back a character
Qt: switch to fixed-width font for menus
Qt: don't disable [cancel] button when viewing inventory or other pick-none
	menus; ESC works to dismiss those and [cancel] should be the same
Qt: clicking on the window's Close button brought up a dialog offering
	choices of "Save" and "Cancel"; picking Cancel sent nethack into an
	infinite loop with complaints about Qt's event loop already being
	active; change dialog: offer "Save and exit" or "Quit without saving"
	with no opportunity to try to back out of the Close operation
Qt: add 3.6 status fields Stone, Slime, Strngl, Deaf, Lev, Fly, Ride
Qt: add Attributes, Overview, and Annotate to the "Info" pull down menu
Qt: rename menu entries game->Save to game->Save-and-exit and game->Quit
	to game->Quit-without-saving
Qt: menu commands are now working; commands invoked via M-c were having that
	keystroke changed to '?', bringing up nethack's help menu; now those
	send #abc with just enough letters to disambiguate from other commands
	("Compilation" is one remaining problem; it yields "#version" which
	brings up '#' menu subset with choices of "version" and "versionshort")
Qt: "paper doll" subset of persistent inventory has undergone several changes:
	show previously missing quiver below weapon instead of duplicating
	gloves there; show secondary weapon in shield slot and blank out
	alternate weapon slot when two-weapon combat is active; show wielded
	two-handed weapon in both the shield and primary weapon slots; show
	first active light source in a previously unused slot on lower right;
	show first leash-in-use in a previously unused slot on lower left
Qt: paper doll inventory view was inconsistently updated during Hallucination
Qt: when hero died, gold on tombstone only included gold in inventory, not
	any additional gold inside carried containers; also, inventory gold
	will be zero if bones get created for all 3.6.x and for 3.4.x+GOLDOBJ
Qt: tombstone showed newly constructed date instead of the value set up at
	time of death; it only shows year but that could be wrong if player
	stared at or ignored prior --More-- for long enough on 31 December
Qt: menu choices All, None, Invert were setting, unsetting, or toggling menu
	entry checkboxes internally but didn't redraw the menu to show that
Qt: fix the F1/F2/Tab macro keys to not require that number_pad be On
Qt: unhighlight highlighted message (last one issued) after player has seen it
Qt: update message window's last message with player's response if it's a
	prompt string for a single-character of input (ynaq or invent letter)
Qt: for line input, display the prompt+response in the message window
Qt: enable the popup_dialog WC option (result is a bit flakey but usable)
Qt: 3.6 catchup - show unexplored locations as unexplored rather than as stone
Qt: tried to honor 'showexp' but the value was unintentionally suppressed by
	[lack of definition for] obsolete conditional EXP_ON_BOTL
Qt: implement --More-- prompt to support MSGTYPE=stop
Qt: for menu search, don't require clicking on the search target popup before
	typing target string (was using typed letters to make menu selections
	if player didn't click on the popup first)
Qt: rest ("Zz") button on the toolbar only worked when 'rest_on_space' was On
	(core issue, not Qt's fault)
Qt: rename toolbar button "Get" and action menu choice "Get" to "Pick up"
Qt: status icons for alignment|hunger|encumbrance which started out centered
	relative to the label text below them would shift to being left
	justified when status got updated
Qt: handle '&' properly if it occurs as part of yn_function popup dialog
Qt: fix the display side of saved game selection; character names for
	available save files are shown in a column of push buttons instead
	of each button overwriting all the ones before it
Qt: don't clobber an existing save file after choosing "new game" in the
	saved game selection widget
Qt: don't get stuck in a loop after choosing "play" while the character name
	field is empty in the character selection widget
Qt: when a new message is issued, pan the message window to its left edge if
	player panned it horizontally then didn't manually scroll it back
Qt: there was no way to enter extended command "#version" by typing; command
	name matching was waiting to disambiguate it from "#versionshort"
	and the only way to that was to type #version<return> but <return>
	explicitly triggered rejection, cancelling '#' processing; #drop vs
	"droptype, "known vs "knownclass, and #takeoff vs #takeoffall are in
	similar ambiguous situation but usually invoked via keystroke
Qt: render all text windows in fixed-width font instead of just ones which
	have one or more lines with four consecutive spaces; some data.base
	entries do have those (usually final attribution) and some don't,
	so display from one entry to another was inconsistent if default
	proportional font was ever used
Qt: while a text window was shown (such as the "things that are here" popup
	when stepping on items), typing commands had the input passed on to
	the map and then executed; sometimes that caused the not-yet-dismissed
	text window to hang
Qt: {maybe just Qt+OSX:} when viewing a text window ('V' to look at 'history'
	for instance), clicking on [Search], entering a search target in the
	resulting popup and clicking on [Okay] or typing <return>, the text
	window got pushed underneath the main window so seemed to go away
Qt+OSX: fix control key (fixed all except for ^V); handle ^V as a shortcut key
Qt+OSX: rename menu entry "nethack->Preferences..." for invoking nethack's
	'O' command to "Game->Run-time options" and entry "Game->Qt settings"
	for making persistent Qt customizations to "nethack->Preferences..."
Qt+OSX: prevent game->Quit-without-saving from being hijacked for the nethack
	menu by renaming it game->_Quit-without-saving (OSX only)
Qt+OSX: add a separate nethack->Quit menu entry with different functionality;
	Command+Q invokes it
Qt+OSX: since menu entry help->"About Qt NetHack" gets hijacked and becomes
	"nethack->About nethack", add a separate help->_About_Qt_NetHack_
	which stays where intended and brings up the same information
Qt+OSX: suppress unwanted "Search [______]" action from being inserted as the
	first entry in the menubar's "Help" dropdown menu
tiles: add indicator of thonged portion to aklys tile
tty: role and race selection menus weren't filtering out potential choices
	which got excluded by OPTIONS=align:!lawful or !neutral or !chaotic
tty: '$' can now select gold in a menu even when it isn't on current page
Unix: when user name is used as default character name, keep hyphenated value
	intact instead stripping off dash and whatever follows as if that
	specified role/race/&c (worked once upon a time; broken since 3.3.0)
Unix: add "ec2-user" to the list of user names 'sysconf' classifies as generic
user_sounds: move the message hook from inside individual window display ports
	to the core where it allows MSGTYP_NOSHOW msgtyp's to still trigger
	sounds to correct a reported github issue; also fixes a past reported
	issue that the curses port on Windows not working with user_sounds
Windows: update for new status condition fields
Windows: include commented-out 'PORTABLE_DEVICE_PATHS' in sysconf.template
X11: substantial overhaul of status display, both 'fancy' and 'tty-style'
X11: extend fancy status one-turn inverse video status-change highlighting to
	hunger, encumbrance, and conditions
X11: stop including unused column 0 in the map
X11: avoid 'bad Atom X Error' when perm_invent is enabled (seemingly window
	manager dependent)
X11: toggling 'perm_invent' off via 'O' didn't dismiss persistent inventory
	window
X11: with 'slow' resource set to False, the pop up yn_function didn't always
	resize properly when re-used
X11: (possibly X11+OSX): if persistent inventory was displayed at time of
	end-of-game prompting, prompting would stall until that window was
	manually dismissed


General New Features
--------------------
if a killer bee encounters a lump of royal jelly and there is no queen bee on
	the level, the bee will eat the jelly and become a new queen
automatic annotation "gateway to Moloch's Sanctum" for vibrating square level
	once that square's location becomes known (found or magic mapped);
	goes away once sanctum temple is found (entered or high altar mapped)
savefile: add support to deconstruct internal data structures down into their
	individual fields and save those fields instead of the entire struct
savefile: use little-endian format for fields where that makes a difference
replace build-time level compiler and dungeon compiler with run-time loading of
	the dungeon and level descriptions and interpreting them via Lua
split off some of the functionality that was in makedefs (compiled-in options
	build date/time, etc) so that it can be built by a cross-compiler
	and accessed on the target platform
replace quest.txt and associated conversion to quest.dat via makedefs with
	Lua quest texts loaded at runtime
callback lua functions from core at certain game actions
some altars are displayed in different colors (for tty and curses at least)
add 'quick_farsight' option to provide some control over random clairvoyance
	where pausing to be able to browse temporarily visible aspects of the
	revealed map can seem intrusive; doesn't affect clairvoyance spell

when hallucinating, see hallucinated currencies instead of bits for an ale
when hallucinating, see hallucinated liquids when looking at water or lava
	on the map

	"secret door" when at a door or wall location), hidden corridor
	spots ("secret corridor" at a corridor location), clouds and walls
tiny chance for randomly created spellbooks to be Discworld novels instead
	of having only one in the first book or scroll shop created (won't
	occur in hero's initial inventory or NPC priest inventory or be
	bestowed as a prayer boon or be found in statues)
'goldX', 'implicit_uncursed', and 'mention_walls' options changed to be
	persistent across save/restore
wearing a wet towel confers "half damage from poison gas" attribute

	available as an encoded value in xlogfile) along with 'conduct'
more grades of self-appearance than beautiful or handsome vs ugly
when 'color' if Off and 'use_inverse' is On, draw ice on the map in inverse
	video if it uses the same character as room floor or as dark floor
new 'mention_decor' option; when On, describe dungeon features being stepped
	on or floated/flown over even when they're not covered by objects
applying royal jelly on an egg kills, revives, or changes the egg
intelligent monsters pick up and rummage through containers
toggling 'travel' option Off now only inhibits travel by mouse click, not by
	'_' command where choosing the destination provides a chance to cancel
different glyphs and symbols for stone and unexplored areas
new glyph GLYPH_NOTHING was added so !dark_room has something to be set to
	now that stone could be mapped to an entirely different symbol
added several new status conditions all of which are opt-in except
	the new cond_grab and cond_lava which are opt-out
tipping your cap might get a response
special levels can be flipped horizontally and/or vertically
new special level initialization routine, "swamp"
demon lords and princes suppress teleporting in Gehennom
for !fixinv option where inventory letters normally don't stick, try to put

	from among "true", "yes", "on", or 1 and "false", "no", "off", or 0
record number of wishes and artifact wishes in xlogfile
give feedback for '#chat' directed at walls
add 'Sokoban' conduct, tracking the number of times the special Sokoban rules
	which incur luck penalties have been violated; don't report it
	unless/until Sokoban branch has been entered
reduce verbosity when a mind flayer attacks a headless monster; when a
	tentacle-to-head attack hits but fails to accomplish anything skip
	remaining attacks (mind flayer has 3, master mind flayer has 5)
add section marker [] support to run-time config file; CHOOSE section1,section2
	followed by [section1] ... [section2] ... forced all the rest of the
	file to be part of the last section; that still works the same, but []
	can be used to terminate the last section and revert to common options
	for the remainder of the file
render the color names in the corresponding color when using the pick-a-color
	menu for adding status highlights or menu colors via 'O'
reading blessed scroll of teleportation confers one-shot teleport control
mild zombie apocalypse
list lamps and lanterns in charging prompt
let tourists read conical hats
when "?i" (show key bindings) displays commands and their keys, also show

make #herecmdmenu and #therecmdmenu autocomplete
add 'sortdiscoveries' option to control output of '\' and '`' commands
include an indication of monsters' health during farlook feedback (including
	/M and autodescribe); also include it in death reason when killed by
	a monster: "killed by {an uninjured newt,a heavily injured mumak}"
[later: suppress the indication of monsters' health]
make DOAGAIN (^A) become unconditional; commenting it out in config.h makes
	it be bound to NUL, a no-op, but allows BIND=k:repeat to set it to k

	and gender-neutral naming terms
add support for a single monster species to have distinct male and female
	tiles
consolidate several monsters that differed only by their gender into their

give feedback when boolean options are toggled interactively ('O' command)
'|' command (#perminv) for interacting with persistent inventory display
	(curses and X11 only)
menu_shift_left, menu_shift_right menu command keys; default '{' and '}'
	(curses for perm_invent only; implemented for X11 too but menus for
	it lack horizontal scroll bars so the shifts don't work there)
using 'f' while quiver is empty and 'autoquiver' is Off when wielding a
	thrown-and-return weapon will throw that weapon instead of filling
	the quiver (inspired by xNetHack)
3.6's tribute: add one new passage to Sourcery, three to Small Gods, one to
	Lords and Ladies, two to Soul Music, three to Interesting Times, four
	to Maskerade, three to Hogfather, two to Jingo, four to The Last

vomiting on an altar provokes the deities wrath
branch stairs have a different glyph, show up in yellow color in tty
duration of confusion when drinking booze depends upon hunger state


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific New Features
------------------------------------------------
user_sounds: provide an experimental mechanism for terminal-side sounds similar
	to the method used for vt_tiledata; new option vt_sounddata that also
	requires compile-time definition of TTY_SOUND_ESCCODES (also requires
	terminal-side code external to NetHack to recognize the sequence and
	act on it)
curses: implement 'selectsaved', restore via menu of saved games
curses: implement selecting menu items via mouse
curses: 'windowborders' can be set to 3 or 4 to suppress perm_invent borders
	to provide slightly more room for actual inventory info
curses: if panictrace is triggered, reset the terminal before giving backtrace
Qt: the "paper doll" inventory subset can be controlled via the "Qt Settings"
	dialog box ("Preferences..." on OSX)
Qt: draw a border around each tile in the paper doll inventory; when BUC is
	known for a doll item, change the border's color and thicken it
Qt: letting the mouse hover over the paper doll shows a tool tip describing
	the object--or lack of same--in the slot under the pointer
Qt: clicking on the paper doll runs the #seeall command (inventory of wielded
	and worn items plus tools [lamps, leashes] actively in use; in other
	words, same set of things whose tiles are used to populate the doll)
Qt: clicking on the status window runs the #attributes command (^X)
Qt: add a Search button to the toolbar
Qt: support the 'hitpointbar' option
Qt: add Filter, Layout, and Reset buttons to the extended command selector;
	Filter is only useful in wizard mode, allowing changing the set of
	extended commands between "all", "normal mode only", "extra wizard
	mode only"; Layout redisplays the grid of command buttons, toggling
	from down columns to across rows or vice versa; Reset puts both back
	to their default settings and clears any pending typed input
Qt: [later] augment extended command selection dialog's Filter to add a
	fourth subset, those commands which autocomplete when typed for tty,
	typically commands with no keystroke or only meta character keystroke;
	that makes Filter useful in normal mode (much shorter list of choices)
tiles: male and female variations in monsters.txt; tested only with tile2bmp
	conversion utility so far; also supported by tilemap utility to
	generate tile.c
tty: use bright colors directly on supporting terminals
Unix: can define NOSUSPEND in config.h or src/Makefile's CFLAGS to prevent
	unixconf.h from enabling SUSPEND without need to modify unixconf.h
X11: implement 'selectsaved', restore via menu of saved games
X11: echo getline prompt and response (wishes, applying names) to message
	window and dumplog message history

more current Qt for Qt version 4 and 5 moved from win/Qt4 to win/Qt; qt4
	moniker changed to qt_
window-port-interface: add_menu() modified to take a more general itemflags
	parameter to support uses beyond just 'preselected'
window-port-interface: start_menu() modified to take a new mbehavior parameter

unified the code for multishot class bonus code
unified the code for obtaining the inventory letter value for sortloot
unified the code for (un)locking boxes in inventory
unified the code for finding room pos for some features
unified the code for revealing hiding monsters for mvm attacks
options overhaul: moved the option definitions into include/optlist.h;
	combined the boolean and compound options into one allopt[] array;
	each option has its own individual function for setting the option,
	for retrieving the option value, and for processing the option
	following its selection in the 'O' menu, added doc/options.doc file.
function reglyph_darkroom() relocated from options.c to display.c
