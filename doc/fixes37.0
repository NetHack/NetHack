General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
hero polymorphed into a vampire can use #monster to shape-shift rather than
	just do a one-shot polymorph into bat/cloud/wolf and shifted vampire
	hero can use #monster again to take on another form (randomly chosen
	among the shiftable shapes and true vampire form)
adjust bones filename buffer sizes to accommodate suffix
fix internal self-recover to work with recent fields added to checkpoint file
improvements to pronoun usage when hallucinating
function calls made from mapglyph based on dungeon level are now called once
	per level
fast hero could have random clairvoyance happen more than once on same turn
using 'Q' on wielded weapon would offer to split stack; make using 'w' on a
	quivered stack behave similarly
weight for giant spider was too low for creature of size 'large';
	weight for giant beetle was much too low for 'large'
leave some menu items out of "invert all" via '@' when their inclusion would
	degrade the usefulness of that interface feature
change crysknife from mineral to bone and worm tooth from unspecified to bone
worn meat ring shouldn't cause increased hunger; neither should fake Amulet
worn +0 ring of protection should cause increased hunger if it is the only
	source of extrinsic Protection
monster wielding Stormbringer or healer's Staff against another monster would
	heal the hero instead of the wielding monster when draining life
change twoweapon feedback from "not a weapon" to "not a suitable weapon"
don't allow twoweapon combat if either weapon is a bow, crossbow, or sling
	[later: or arrows, bolts, and missiles (darts, shuriken, boomerangs)]
drum of earthquake feedback reported various things (fountains, thrones, &c)
	falling into a chasm but they remained intact because trap creation
	had been changed to not clobber such things (so couldn't make pits)
make earthquake which hits a secret door or a secret corridor reveal it
wizard mode wishing for "Amulet of Yendor" had 50:50 chance for true Amulet
	or a cheap plastic imitation; recognize "real Amulet of Yendor" and
	"fake Amulet of Yendor" to precisely specify either of them but also
	take away the 50% chance of yielding a fake one when neither real nor
	fake is specified
unpaid globs showed weight info unconditionally outside of wizmode
walking out of tethered-to-buried-object trap condition was supposed to
	reinstate punishment but wasn't finding the buried iron ball because
	the trap condition was cleared first to indicate escape; result was
	attached chain that got dragged around but had no ball attached
when poly'd into a giant and moving onto a boulder's spot, message given was
	confused about whether autopickup would occur so could be misleading
random role selection wasn't honoring unwanted alignment(s) properly
if at the edge of the map window, trying to move farther fails but used a turn
hero can no longer wear blindfold/towel/lenses when poly'd into headless form
revamp achievement tracking for exploring Mine's End and Sokoban (by acquiring
	luckstone and bag of holding or amulet of reflection, respectively)

poly'd hero was able to zap wands, apply tools, and #rub objects without
	having any hands
spellcasting monster got an extra move after casting
allow defining #wizgenesis quantity in the prompt
digging through iron bars from an adjacent pit made a pit on top of the bars
give feedback if controlled level teleport attempt fails because hero is
	already on the bottom level and player tries to go even deeper
unseen pet that drowned didn't give "you have a sad feeling" message
prevent ravens from blinding other ravens: /corvus oculum corvi non eruit/
have ^X provide more information when held or swallowed
display wasn't updating immediately after toggling hilite_pet option
randomly choosing role could lead to crash via segfault
if eel bite attack caused hero to move (killed + rehumanized + crawled out
	of water), its grab attack could succeed even if no longer adjacent
specifying a count when picking [part of] a stack of scrolls of scare monster
	ignored that count and the whole stack was affected
wizmakemap didn't account for unique monsters and didn't correct monster
	birth counts
generate objects (eg. statues) with genocided or extinct monster classes
	in special levels, if requested
if the orc-town version of mine town has been loaded, creation of orc zombies
	or orc mummies would name them as part of the town raiding orc clan
when punished, involuntarily teleporting and landing within chain range of
	attached ball while encumbered worse than burdened could trigger
	"remove_object: obj not on floor" panic on hero's next move
inventory cursing caused by "this water's no good" effect when drinking from
	a fountain didn't update persistent inventory window
fix priest created inside temple wall
fix vault guard occasionally encasing monsters in stone
tone down scare monster by excluding humans and uniques
lock the castle chest
revamp amnesia to forget skills instead of objects or maps
when Punished and carrying the iron ball and levitating, hurtling in the
	opposite direction of a thrown object didn't bring along the chain
recognize "kirin" as alias for "ki-rin" when asked to create a monster
make unique swallowing monsters (Juiblex) resist magical digging from inside
correctly account for fuel remaining when lit candles are attached
	to candelabrum (the previous code would make the game unwinnable if
	there were 15 or fewer turns remaining)
praying on an unaligned altar outside of Gehennom behaved like an ordinary
	prayer; make that always fail
Discworld typo: Moving Pictures passage 12 "or" -> "of"
unicorn corpses and wraith corpses could be sacrificed even if "too old"
hero polymorphed into a hider and hiding was not unhidden when teleporting
impose tighter restraints on 'summon nasties', both for spellcasting monsters
	and post-Wizard harassment
prevent swallowing monster ending up in a solid wall if it killed vault guard
fix attached ball getting deallocated if swallowed, going down into a pit,
	and saving
level compiler creates correct novel with supplied name
for farlook, describe water in the castle moat and in Juiblex's swamp as moat
	and as swamp, respectively, rather than just as "water"
make hezrous emit poison clouds when they move
stepping from one type of terrain to another was triggering an unnecessary
	status update
make shriekers summon baby purple worms if purple worms would be too tough
make non-tame (baby) purple worms eat corpses off the ground
make baby purple worms attack shriekers
make hero polymorphed into baby purple worm warned against shriekers
confused scroll of light summons tame cancelled lights
potions of hallucination can give enlightenment
add a small chance of surviving food poisoning
deliberate level teleporter activation ignores magic resistance
auto-id scroll of remove curse when a known buc-state was changed
demon lords hate Demonbane
pets avoid eating shapeshifter corpses unless starving or nearly feral
blessed scroll of teleportation gives a single controlled teleport
allow opening a tin without interruption if slimed
tell player when wielding a different weapon toggles off dual-wielding
object taking erosion damage might give feedback message when out of view
	or not give such when in view, depending on stale value of 'bhitpos'
	[cited case assumed message came from drowned monster's dropped
	inventory when out-of-view ice melted]
it's possible to wish for tins of the Riders in wizard mode; eating one is
	fatal but if you're life-saved or decline to die, the game crashed
revival via undead turning of corpse carried by hero said "your <mon> corpse
	comes alive" even when revived monster was undead
prevent searching or waiting next to a hostile monster - override with 'm'
allow random mimics to show up mimicing more furniture than just stairs
scatter exploding bag of holding contents instead of outright deleting them
male hero poly'd into nymph chooses charm vs seduce message based on being
	male rather than on all nymphs being female but charm message was
	using hardcoded pronouns She,her for target monster--wrong for male
	target and noticable if "<mon> finishes taking off his suit" is given
hostile monsters with launcher and ammo try to stay away from melee range
allow displacing peaceful creatures
unicorn horns don't restore attribute loss anymore
when a shop is changed from food to health food, change room type to match
wish parsing of things containing monster names would accept all supported
	alternate spellings if they occurred at the end ("corpse of mumakil")
	but only some when they occurred elsewhere ("gray-elf corpse" worked,
	"mumakil corpse" yielded "does not exist") depending upon name length
couldn't wish for werecreature corpse or tin because monster name lookup
	always matched the beast form which is flagged no-corpse; switch to
	human form for "were<creature>"
wishing for werecreature figurine always made one that created the monster in
	beast form if activated; allow "human were<creature>" to explicitly
	specify werecreature's human form (for corpses and tins as well as
	figurines); override the restriction against human figurines for that
wishing for "royal jelly" yielded "lump of royal jelly" as a special case, but
	other 'of' items such as "clove of garlic", "sprig of wolfsbane", or
	"piece of cloth" didn't allow using their post-of words as shorthand
monster or object detection found semi-dead vault guard at <0,0> while
	traversing fmon list; monster detection gave misleading feedback
	(blank map instead of 'strange feeling') if there were no other
	monsters on level; likewise object detection and guard's minvent
squadprob[] in mkroom.c was defined with 5 elements but initialized only 4
	resulting in giant ants sometimes
allow nurses heal attack when wielding a non-weapon/weaptool
if riding or levitating, hero could apply bullwhip downward to pull up things
	from underwater or lava; feedback implied the item was on the surface
some monster code was checking whether pets or engulfers were eating green
	slime by checking for green slime corpse instead of glob
change light radius of stack of candles to square root
could get redundate "mon hits other-mon" messages when mon wields an artifact
failed untrap while mounted that moved hero onto the trap would leave steed
	with stale coordinates, triggering warnings if 'sanity_check' is On
when hold_another_object() fails while hero is swallowed, drop the item into
	swallower's inventory instead of onto the floor
when digging a pit results in it being filled by adjacent pool or lava, any
	objects at the spot weren't subjected to water or fire damage;
	also, riding hero's steed wasn't subjected to immersion either
after "double trouble", cloned Wizard would wait until he had suffered some
	damage or hero moved into direct view; keep STRAT_WAIT for original
	Wizard but avoid that for clones
beyond turn 100000, prayer timeout is longer (scaling with game length)
falling while going down stairs and dropping items due to encumbrance or
	punishment wasn't subject fragile ones to breakage
objects scattered by an explosion which land on water or lava weren't affected
	by the water or lava


Fixes to 3.7.0-x Problems that Were Exposed Via git Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------
fix compile when DLB isn't defined
urealtime.realtime was being incorrectly calculated
revised "mysterious force" when climbing out of gehennom could generate
	warnings about "rn2(0) attempted" or "rn2(-n) attempted"
after 'w' on split stack patch, wielding '-' would cause an object_lost panic
same patch allowed partial stack from getobj to replace cursed wielded weapon
autounlock of door or chest took no time; chest case depended on whether
	anything got looted along with the unlocking
autounlock with artifact unlocking tool didn't do touch check on that tool
autounlock picked Rogue's artifact key over lock-pick or credit card (or
	ordinary key depending upon invent order) even for non-rogues who
	would be blasted when touching it
wielded aklys had its "(tethered weapon...)" description scrambled
randomized trap name could pick trap #0 which isn't a trap and yielded "water"
if running and Blind or Stunned or Fumbling or Dex < 10, encountering a closed
	door orthogonally would keep reporting "ouch! you bump into a door"
	repeatedly until eventually interrupted by approaching monster or
	hunger or ^C
data.base lookup of an entry with any blank lines would falsely claim that
	"'data' file in wrong fromat or corrupted" after some extra checks
	were added while investigating tab handling anomalies
using nhl_error() to report a Lua processing problem would clobber the stack
level teleporation's "You materialize on a different level!" could be given
	out of sequence with other arrival messages
more sequencing: if wielding Sting or similar and level teleporting to a
	level with different warning effect, the start-glowing or stop-glowing
	message came before the materialize message on the destination level
prevent "you materialize on a different level" after "a mysterious force
	prevents you from descending" if you try to level teleport past the
	stairs down from the quest home level before being granted access
creating Mine Town variant 1 (Orcish Town) sometimes complained about being
	unable to place lregion type 1 and failed to have any staircase up
set g.context.botl for glove and wielding actions that could start or end
	bare-handedness in support of condtests[bl_bareh]
reinstate ranked ordering of the status condition fields
grammar for messages about a monster removing items from a container was bad
some new status conditions didn't always update when they should
fix flipping non-existent stairs and ladders (github #311)
fix door created into random wall or position opening into solid wall
'use_inverse' option was accidentally made Windows-only; change it back to
	being more general; change its default to True
change inconsistent achievement spelling of "Mine Town" to "Minetown"
fix crash in water_damage_chain
teleport feedback "you materialize at another location" was given too soon
'mention_decore' was repeatedly reporting "you are back on bottom" when
	moving around underwater
revised 'mention_decor' was describing furniture or ice right before look-here
	described the same thing when stepping onto object(s)
poison gas clouds located over known but unlit pools were visible as known
	clouds but steam clouds in that situation were not
after the wish parsing change, wishing for "<something of monster>" or for
	"<monster something>" worked as intended but wishing for "<monster>"
	(where <monster> used the canonical spelling) triggered a crash
fix new "objects[0] class #1 not in order!" panic if plain 'char' is unsigned
tty: redraw unexplored locations as S_unexplored rather than <space> after
	map has been partially overwritten by popup menu or text display
tty: previous change resulted in remnants of previous level being shown on
	new level after level change when S_unexplored is <space>
X11: was still initializing map to 'stone' instead of 'unexplored' after they
	became separate glyphs
X11: for text map without color, add support for black&white ice; draw it in
	inverse video to distinguish from ordinary floor
only generate shop items on solid floor squares


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes
-----------------------------------------
msdos:  Add -DSTATUES_LOOK_LIKE_MONSTERS to Makefile1.cross so the VESA mode
	can display statue glyphs. 
tty: role and race selection menus weren't filtering out potential choices
	which got excluded by OPTIONS=align:!lawful or !neutral or !chaotic
Unix: when user name is used as default character name, keep hyphenated value
	intact instead stripping off dash and whatever follows as if that
	specified role/race/&c (worked once upon a time; broken since 3.3.0)
windows: update for new status condition fields
X11: substantial overhaul of status display, both 'fancy' and 'tty-style'
X11: extend fancy status one-turn inverse video status-change highlighting to
	hunger, encumbrance, and conditions
X11: stop including unused column 0 in the map


General New Features
--------------------
if a killer bee encounters a lump of royal jelly and there is no queen bee on
	the level, the bee will eat the jelly and become a new queen
automatic annotation "gateway to Moloch's Sanctum" for vibrating square level
	once that square's location becomes known (found or magic mapped);
	goes away once sanctum temple is found (entered or high altar mapped)
savefile: add support to deconstruct internal data structures down into their
	individual fields and save those fields instead of the entire struct
savefile: use little-endian format for fields where that makes a difference
replace build-time level compiler and dungeon compiler with run-time loading of
	the dungeon and level descriptions and interpreting them via Lua
split off some of the functionality that was in makedefs (compiled-in options
	build date/time, etc) so that it can be built by a cross-compiler
	and accessed on the target platform
replace quest.txt and associated conversion to quest.dat via makedefs with
	Lua quest texts loaded at runtime
some altars are displayed in different colors (for tty and curses at least)
add 'quick_farsight' option to provide some control over random clairvoyance
	where pausing to be able to browse temporarily visible aspects of the
	revealed map can seem intrusive; doesn't affect clairvoyance spell
replace "money" in in-game texts with "gold"
when hallucinating, see hallucinated currencies instead of bits for an ale
when hallucinating, see hallucinated liquids when looking at water or lava
	on the map
applying a spellbook hints about read charges left
wizard mode wishing for level topology can now create hidden doors (ask for
	"secret door" when at a door or wall location), hidden corridor
	spots ("secret corridor" at a corridor location), and clouds
tiny chance for randomly created spellbooks to be Discworld novels instead
	of having only one in the first book or scroll shop created (won't
	occur in hero's initial inventory or NPC priest inventory or be
	bestowed as a prayer boon or be found in statues)
'goldX', 'implicit_uncursed', and 'mention_walls' options changed to be
	persistent across save/restore
wearing a wet towel confers "half damage from poison gas" attribute
for end of game disclosure and dumplog, show 'achievements' (previously only
	available as an encoded value in xlogfile) along with 'conduct'
more grades of self-appearance than beautiful or handsome vs ugly
when 'color' if Off and 'use_inverse' is On, draw ice on the map in inverse
	video if it uses the same character as room floor or as dark floor
new 'mention_decor' option; when On, describe dungeon features being stepped
	on or floated/flown over even when they're not covered by objects
applying royal jelly on an egg kills, revives, or changes the egg
intelligent monsters pick up and rummage through containers
toggling 'travel' option Off now only inhibits travel by mouse click, not by
	'_' command where choosing the destination provides a chance to cancel
different glyphs and symbols for stone and unexplored areas
new glyph GLYPH_NOTHING was added so !dark_room has something to be set to
	now that stone could be mapped to an entirely different symbol
added several new status conditions all of which are opt-in except
	the new cond_grab and cond_lava which are opt-out
tipping your cap might get a response
special levels can be flipped horizontally and/or vertically
new special level initialization routine, "swamp"
demon lords and princes suppress teleporting in Gehennom
for !fixinv option where inventory letters normally don't stick, try to put
	a throw-and-return weapon back into the same inventory slot it gets
	thrown from; only works if it does return and is successfully caught
wizard mode #wizborn command
include more skill information in ^X output when dual-wielding
item-using monsters will zap wand of undead turning at corpse-wielding hero
	when the corpse is harmful
boiling a pool or fountain now creates a temporary cloud of steam
random themed rooms in the dungeons of doom
extended achievement and conduct fields for xlogfile
record amount of gold in hero's possession in xlogfile
new objects:  amulets of flying and guarding
new monsters:  displacer beast ('f') and genetic engineer ('Q')
make camera flash which reveals previously unseen map features or objects or
	monsters record those on the hero's map; monsters revert to 'unseen'
