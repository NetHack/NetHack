fix the article used in the message when your steed encounters a polymorph trap
allow teleporting onto the vibrating square
message "your knapsack can't accommodate any more items" when picking stuff up

wizard mode wishing for terrain would leave it unmapped if done while blind
wizard mode terrain wish could leave hero in water (severe vision limits) or
	in lava (trapped, sinking) which wasn't there any more

polymorphed hero hiding on the ceiling can now use '>' to unhide instead of
	being told "you can't go down here"
