          1.  Introduction

               Recently,  you  have  begun to find yourself unfulfilled and
          distant in your daily occupation.  Strange dreams of prospecting,
          stealing,  crusading,  and  combat have haunted you in your sleep
          for many months, but you aren't sure of the reason.   You  wonder
          whether  you have in fact been having those dreams all your life,
          and somehow managed to forget about them until now.  Some  nights
          you awaken suddenly and cry out, terrified at the vivid recollec-
          tion of the strange and powerful creatures that seem to be  lurk-
          ing  behind  every  corner  of  the dungeon in your dream.  Could
          these details haunting  your  dreams  be  real?   As  each  night
          passes,  you feel the desire to enter the mysterious caverns near
          the ruins grow stronger.  Each morning, however, you quickly  put
          the  idea  out  of your head as you recall the tales of those who
          entered the caverns before you and did  not  return.   Eventually
          you  can  resist  the yearning to seek out the fantastic place in
          your dreams no longer.  After all, when  other  adventurers  came
          back  this  way  after spending time in the caverns, they usually
          seemed better off than when they passed through the  first  time.
          And  who  was to say that all of those who did not return had not
          just kept going?

               Asking around, you hear about a bauble, called the Amulet of
          Yendor  by  some, which, if you can find it, will bring you great
          wealth.  One legend you were told even mentioned that the one who
          finds  the  amulet  will be granted immortality by the gods.  The
          amulet is rumored to be somewhere beyond the Valley of  Gehennom,
          deep  within  the Mazes of Menace.  Upon hearing the legends, you
          immediately realize that there is some profound and  undiscovered
          reason that you are to descend into the caverns and seek out that
          amulet of which they spoke.  Even if the rumors of  the  amulet's
          powers are untrue, you decide that you should at least be able to
          sell the tales of your adventures to the local  minstrels  for  a
          tidy  sum,  especially if you encounter any of the terrifying and
          magical creatures of your dreams along the way.   You  spend  one
          last  night  fortifying  yourself at the local inn, becoming more
          and more depressed as you watch the odds of  your  success  being
          posted on the inn's walls getting lower and lower.

               In  the  morning you awake, collect your belongings, and set
          off for the dungeon.  After several days  of  uneventful  travel,
          you  see the ancient ruins that mark the entrance to the Mazes of
          Menace.  It is late at night, so you make camp  at  the  entrance
          and  spend the night sleeping under the open skies.  In the morn-
          ing, you gather your gear, eat what may be your  last  meal  out-
          side, and enter the dungeon....

          2.  What is going on here?

               You have just begun a game of NetHack.  Your goal is to grab
          as much treasure as you can, retrieve the Amulet of  Yendor,  and
          escape the Mazes of Menace alive.

               Your abilities and strengths for dealing with the hazards of
          adventure will vary with your background and training:

               Archeologists understand dungeons pretty well; this  enables
          them  to  move  quickly  and sneak up on the local nasties.  They
          start equipped with the tools for a proper scientific expedition.

               Barbarians are warriors out of the hinterland,  hardened  to
          battle.   They  begin  their  quests  with  naught  but  uncommon
          strength, a trusty hauberk, and a great two-handed sword.

               Cavemen and Cavewomen start with exceptional  strength  but,
          unfortunately, with neolithic weapons.

               Healers  are wise in medicine and apothecary.  They know the
          herbs and simples that can restore  vitality,  ease  pain,  anes-
          thetize, and neutralize poisons; and with their instruments, they
          can divine a being's state of health or sickness.  Their  medical
          practice earns them quite reasonable amounts of money, with which
          they enter the dungeon.

               Knights are distinguished  from  the  common  skirmisher  by
          their  devotion  to  the ideals of chivalry and by the surpassing
          excellence of their armor.

               Monks are ascetics, who by rigorous practice of physical and
          mental disciplines have become capable of fighting as effectively
          without weapons as with.  They wear no armor but make up  for  it
          with increased mobility.

               Priests  and Priestesses are clerics militant, crusaders ad-
          vancing the cause of righteousness with  arms,  armor,  and  arts
          thaumaturgic.   Their  ability to commune with deities via prayer
          occasionally extricates them from peril, but can also put them in
          it.

               Rangers are most at home in the woods, and some say slightly
          out of place in a dungeon.  They are, however, experts in archery
          as well as tracking and stealthy movement.



          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                               3



               Rogues  are  agile  and  stealthy thieves, with knowledge of
          locks, traps, and poisons.  Their  advantage  lies  in  surprise,
          which they employ to great advantage.

               Samurai  are  the elite warriors of feudal Nippon.  They are
          lightly armored and quick, and wear the dai-sho,  two  swords  of
          the deadliest keenness.

               Tourists  start out with lots of gold (suitable for shopping
          with), a credit card, lots of food, some maps, and  an  expensive
          camera.  Most monsters don't like being photographed.

               Valkyries  are hardy warrior women.  Their upbringing in the
          harsh Northlands makes them strong, inures them  to  extremes  of
          cold, and instills in them stealth and cunning.

               Wizards  start out with a knowledge of magic, a selection of
          magical items, and a particular affinity for  dweomercraft.   Al-
          though seemingly weak and easy to overcome at first sight, an ex-
          perienced Wizard is a deadly foe.

               You may also choose the race of your character (within  lim-
          its; most roles have restrictions on which races are eligible for
          them):

               Dwarves are smaller than humans or elves, but are stocky and
          solid  individuals.   Dwarves'  most notable trait is their great
          expertise in mining and metalwork.  Dwarvish armor is said to  be
          second in quality not even to the mithril armor of the Elves.

               Elves  are agile, quick, and perceptive; very little of what
          goes on will escape an Elf.  The quality of  Elven  craftsmanship
          often gives them an advantage in arms and armor.

               Gnomes  are  smaller  than but generally similar to dwarves.
          Gnomes are known to be expert miners, and it is known that a  se-
          cret  underground  mine  complex built by this race exists within
          the Mazes of Menace, filled with both riches and danger.

               Humans are by far the most common race of the surface world,
          and  are  thus  the norm to which other races are often compared.
          Although they have no special abilities, they can succeed in  any
          role.

               Orcs  are  a  cruel and barbaric race that hate every living
          thing (including other orcs).  Above all others, Orcs hate  Elves
          with  a  passion unequalled, and will go out of their way to kill
          one at any opportunity.  The armor and weapons fashioned  by  the
          Orcs are typically of inferior quality.

          3.  What do all those things on the screen mean?

               On  the screen is kept a map of where you have been and what
          you have seen on the current dungeon level; as you  explore  more


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                               4



          of the level, it appears on the screen in front of you.

               When  NetHack's  ancestor  rogue  first appeared, its screen
          orientation was  almost  unique  among  computer  fantasy  games.
          Since  then,  screen  orientation has become the norm rather than
          the exception; NetHack continues  this  fine  tradition.   Unlike
          text  adventure games that accept commands in pseudo-English sen-
          tences and explain the results in words, NetHack commands are all
          one  or  two keystrokes and the results are displayed graphically
          on the screen.  A minimum screen size of 24 lines by  80  columns
          is  recommended;  if  the  screen is larger, only a 21x80 section
          will be used for the map.

               NetHack can even be played by blind players,  with  the  as-
          sistance of Braille readers or speech synthesisers.  Instructions
          for configuring NetHack for the blind are included later in  this
          document.

               NetHack generates a new dungeon every time you play it; even
          the authors still find it an entertaining and exciting  game  de-
          spite having won several times.

               NetHack  offers  a  variety of display options.  The options
          available to you will vary from port to port,  depending  on  the
          capabilities  of  your hardware and software, and whether various
          compile-time options were enabled when your executable  was  cre-
          ated.  The three possible display options are: a monochrome char-
          acter interface, a color character interface, and a graphical in-
          terface using small pictures called tiles.  The two character in-
          terfaces allow fonts with other characters to be substituted, but
          the  default  assignments use standard ASCII characters to repre-
          sent everything.  There is no difference between the various dis-
          play options with respect to game play.  Because we cannot repro-
          duce the tiles or colors in the Guidebook, and because it is com-
          mon  to  all ports, we will use the default ASCII characters from
          the monochrome character display when  referring  to  things  you
          might see on the screen during your game.

               In  order  to  understand what is going on in NetHack, first
          you must understand what NetHack is doing with the  screen.   The
          NetHack  screen  replaces  the "You see ..." descriptions of text
          adventure games.  Figure 1 is a sample of what a  NetHack  screen
          might  look  like.   The  way the screen looks for you depends on
          your platform.

          3.1.  The status lines (bottom)

               The bottom two (or three) lines of the screen  contain  sev-
          eral  cryptic  pieces of information describing your current sta-
          tus.  Figure 1 shows the traditional two-line status  area  below
          the  map.   Figure  2  shows  just the status area, when the sta-
          tuslines:3 option has been set (not all interfaces  support  this
          option).   If  any status line becomes wider than the screen, you
          might not see all of it due to truncation.  When the numbers grow
          bigger  and  multiple conditions are present, the two-line format
          will run out of room on the second line, but statuslines:2 is the
          default  because  a  basic 24-line terminal isn't tall enough for
          the third line.

               Here are explanations of what the various status items mean:

          Title
               Your character's name and  professional  ranking  (based  on
               role and experience level, see below).

          Strength
               A  measure of your character's strength; one of your six ba-
               sic attributes.  A human character's  attributes  can  range
               from  3  to 18 inclusive; non-humans may exceed these limits
               (occasionally you may get super-strengths of the form 18/xx,
               and  magic  can  also  cause attributes to exceed the normal
               limits).  The higher your strength, the  stronger  you  are.
               Strength  affects  how  successfully  you  perform  physical
               tasks, how much damage you do in combat, and how  much  loot
               you can carry.



          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                               6



          Dexterity
               Dexterity  affects  your  chances to hit in combat, to avoid
               traps, and do other tasks requiring agility or  manipulation
               of objects.

          Constitution
               Constitution  affects  your ability to recover from injuries
               and other strains on your stamina.  When strength is low  or
               modest,  constitution  also  affects how much you can carry.
               With sufficiently high strength, the contribution to  carry-
               ing capacity from your constitution no longer matters.

          Intelligence
               Intelligence  affects  your  ability to cast spells and read
               spellbooks.

          Wisdom
               Wisdom comes from your practical experience (especially when
               dealing with magic).  It affects your magical energy.

          Charisma
               Charisma affects how certain creatures react toward you.  In
               particular, it can affect the prices shopkeepers offer you.

          Alignment
               Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic.  Often, Lawful is taken as good
               and Chaotic as evil, but legal and ethical do not always co-
               incide.  Your alignment influences how other monsters  react
               toward you.  Monsters of a like alignment are more likely to
               be non-aggressive, while those of an opposing alignment  are
               more likely to be seriously offended at your presence.

          Dungeon Level
               How deep you are in the dungeon.  You start at level one and
               the number increases as you  go  deeper  into  the  dungeon.
               Some  levels  are  special, and are identified by a name and
               not a number.  The Amulet of Yendor is reputed to  be  some-
               where beneath the twentieth level.

          Gold
               The  number  of  gold  pieces you are openly carrying.  Gold
               which you have concealed in containers is not counted.

          Hit Points
               Your current and maximum hit points.   Hit  points  indicate
               how  much  damage you can take before you die.  The more you
               get hit in a fight, the lower they get.  You can regain  hit
               points  by  resting,  or  by  using certain magical items or
               spells.  The number in parentheses  is  the  maximum  number
               your hit points can reach.

          Power
               Spell  points.  This tells you how much mystic energy (mana)
               you have available for spell casting.  Again,  resting  will


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023

               regenerate the amount available.

          Armor Class
               A measure of how effectively your armor stops blows from un-
               friendly creatures.  The lower this number is, the more  ef-
               fective the armor; it is quite possible to have negative ar-
               mor class.  See the Armor subsection of Objects for more in-
               formation.

          Experience
               Your  current  experience  level.   If the showexp option is
               set, it will be followed by a slash and  experience  points.
               As  you  adventure,  you gain experience points.  At certain
               experience point totals, you gain an experience level.   The
               more experienced you are, the better you fight and withstand
               magical attacks.  (By the time  your  level  reaches  double
               digits,  the  usefulness  of  showing the points with it has
               dropped significantly.  You can use the `O' command to  turn
               showexp  off  to  avoid  using  up  the  limited status line
               space.)

          Time
               The number of turns elapsed so far, displayed  if  you  have
               the time option set.

          Status
               Hunger:  your  current  hunger status.  Values are Satiated,
               Not Hungry (or Normal), Hungry,  Weak,  and  Fainting.   Not
               shown when Normal.

               Encumbrance:  an indication of how what you are carrying af-
               fects your ability to move.  Values are Unencumbered, Encum-
               bered,  Stressed,  Strained, Overtaxed, and Overloaded.  Not
               shown when Unencumbered.

               Fatal conditions: Stone (aka Petrifying, turning to  stone),
               Slime  (turning into green slime), Strngl (being strangled),
               FoodPois (suffering  from  acute  food  poisoning),  TermIll
               (suffering from a terminal illness).

               Non-fatal  conditions: Blind (can't see), Deaf (can't hear),
               Stun (stunned), Conf (confused), Hallu (hallucinating).

               Movement modifiers: Lev  (levitating),  Fly  (flying),  Ride
               (riding).

               Other conditions and modifiers exist, but there isn't enough
               room to display them with the other status fields.

          The #attributes command (default key ^X) will  show  all  current
          status  information in unabbreviated format.  It also shows other
          information which might be included on the status lines if  those
          had more room.

          3.2.  The message line (top)

               The top line of the screen is reserved for messages that de-
          scribe things that are impossible to represent visually.  If  you
          see a "--More--" on the top line, this means that NetHack has an-
          other message to display on the screen, but it wants to make cer-
          tain  that  you've read the one that is there first.  To read the
          next message, just press the space bar.

               To change how and what messages are  shown  on  the  message
          line, see "Configuring Message Types" and the verbose option.

          3.3.  The map (rest of the screen)

               The  rest  of the screen is the map of the level as you have
          explored it so far.  Each symbol on the screen  represents  some-
          thing.   You  can  set various graphics options to change some of
          the symbols the game uses; otherwise, the game will  use  default
          symbols.  Here is a list of what the default symbols mean:

          - and |
               The walls of a room, or an open door.  Or a grave (|).

          .    The floor of a room, ice, or a doorless doorway.

          #    A  corridor,  or iron bars, or a tree, or possibly a kitchen
               sink (if your dungeon has sinks), or a drawbridge.

          >    Stairs down: a way to the next level.

          <    Stairs up: a way to the previous level.

          +    A closed door, or a spellbook containing a spell you may  be
               able to learn.

          @    Your character or a human.

          $    A pile of gold.

          ^    A trap (once you have detected it).

          )    A weapon.

          [    A suit or piece of armor.

          %    Something edible (not necessarily healthy).

          ?    A scroll.

          /    A wand.

          =    A ring.




          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023

          !    A potion.

          (    A useful item (pick-axe, key, lamp...).

          "    An amulet or a spider web.

          *    A gem or rock (possibly valuable, possibly worthless).

          `    A boulder or statue.

          0    An iron ball.

          _    An altar, or an iron chain.

          {    A fountain.

          }    A pool of water or moat or a pool of lava.

          \    An opulent throne.

          a-zA-Z and other symbols
               Letters  and certain other symbols represent the various in-
               habitants of the Mazes of Menace.  Watch out,  they  can  be
               nasty and vicious.  Sometimes, however, they can be helpful.

          I    This marks the last known location of an invisible or other-
               wise unseen monster.   Note  that  the  monster  could  have
               moved.  The `F' and `m' commands may be useful here.

               You  need  not  memorize  all these symbols; you can ask the
          game what any symbol represents with the  `/'  command  (see  the
          next section for more info).

          4.  Commands

               Commands can be initiated by typing one or two characters to
          which the command is bound to, or typing the command name in  the
          extended  commands  entry.   Some commands, like "search", do not
          require that any more information be collected by NetHack.  Other
          commands  might require additional information, for example a di-
          rection, or an object to be used.  For those  commands  that  re-
          quire  additional  information, NetHack will present you with ei-
          ther a menu of choices or with a command line  prompt  requesting
          information.  Which you are presented with will depend chiefly on
          how you have set the menustyle option.

               For example, a common question, in the  form  "What  do  you
          want  to  use? [a-zA-Z ?*]", asks you to choose an object you are
          carrying.  Here, "a-zA-Z" are the inventory letters of your  pos-
          sible  choices.   Typing `?' gives you an inventory list of these
          items, so you can see what each letter refers to.  In this  exam-
          ple, there is also a `*' indicating that you may choose an object
          not on the list, if you wanted to use something unexpected.  Typ-
          ing  a  `*'  lists  your  entire  inventory,  so  you can see the


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              10



          inventory letters of every object you're carrying.   Finally,  if
          you change your mind and decide you don't want to do this command
          after all, you can press the ESC key to abort the command.

               You can put a number before some  commands  to  repeat  them
          that  many  times;  for example, "10s" will search ten times.  If
          you have the number_pad option set, you must type `n' to prefix a
          count,  so the example above would be typed "n10s" instead.  Com-
          mands for which counts make no sense ignore them.   In  addition,
          movement  commands  can  be prefixed for greater control (see be-
          low).  To cancel a count or a prefix, press the ESC key.

               The list of commands is rather long, but it can be  read  at
          any  time during the game through the `?' command, which accesses
          a menu of helpful texts.  Here are the default key  bindings  for
          your reference:

          ?    Help menu:  display one of several help texts available.

          /    The "whatis" command, to tell what a symbol represents.  You
               may choose to specify a location or type a symbol (or even a
               whole  word)  to  explain.  Specifying a location is done by
               moving the cursor to a particular spot on the map  and  then
               pressing one of `.', `,', `;', or `:'.  `.' will explain the
               symbol at the chosen location, conditionally check for "More
               info?"  depending  upon  whether  the help option is on, and
               then you will be asked to pick another  location;  `,'  will
               explain the symbol but skip any additional information, then
               let you pick another location; `;' will skip additional info
               and also not bother asking you to choose another location to
               examine; `:' will show additional info, if any, without ask-
               ing for confirmation.  When picking a location, pressing the
               ESC key will terminate this command, or  pressing  `?'  will
               give a brief reminder about how it works.

               If  the  autodescribe  option  is on, a short description of
               what you see at each location is shown as you move the  cur-
               sor.   Typing  `#' while picking a location will toggle that
               option on or off.  The whatis_coord option controls  whether
               the short description includes map coordinates.

               Specifying  a  name  rather than a location always gives any
               additional information available about that name.

               You may also request a description of nearby  monsters,  all
               monsters  currently  displayed,  nearby  objects, or all ob-
               jects.  The whatis_coord option controls which format of map
               coordinate is included with their descriptions.

          &    Tell what a command does.

          <    Go  up  to  the previous level (if you are on a staircase or
               ladder).

               Go  one  step in the direction indicated (see Figure 3).  If
               you sense or remember a monster there, you  will  fight  the
               monster  instead.   Only  these  one-step  movement commands
               cause you to fight monsters; the others (below) are "safe."

          [YUHJKLBN]
               Go in that direction until you hit a wall or run into  some-
               thing.

          m[yuhjklbn]
               Prefix:   move  without picking up objects or fighting (even
               if you remember a monster there).

               A few non-movement commands use the `m'  prefix  to  request
               operating    via   menu   (to   temporarily   override   the
               menustyle:traditional option).   Primarily  useful  for  `,'
               (pickup)  when  there  is  only one class of objects present
               (where there won't be any "what kinds of objects?"   prompt,
               so no opportunity to answer `m' at that prompt).

               The prefix will make "#travel" command show a menu of inter-
               esting targets in sight.  It can also be used with  the  `\'
               (known,  show  a list of all discovered objects) and the ``'
               (knownclass, show a list of discovered objects in a particu-
               lar  class)  commands to offer a menu of several sorting al-
               ternatives (which sets a new value for  the  sortdiscoveries
               option);  also  for "#vanquished" command to offer a sorting
               menu.

               A few other commands (eat food, offer sacrifice, apply  tin-
               ning-kit,  drink/quaff, dip, tip container) use the `m' pre-
               fix to skip checking for applicable objects on the floor and
               go straight to checking inventory, or (for "#loot" to remove
               a saddle), skip containers and go straight to adjacent  mon-
               sters.

               In  debug  mode (aka "wizard mode"), the `m' prefix may also
               be used with the "#teleport" and "#wizlevelport" commands.

          F[yuhjklbn]
               Prefix:  fight a monster (even if  you  only  guess  one  is
               there).

          g[yuhjklbn]
               Prefix:  move until something interesting is found.

          G[yuhjklbn] or <Control>+[yuhjklbn]
               Prefix:   similar  to  `g',  but forking of corridors is not
               considered interesting.

               Note:  <Control>+<key> means holding the <Control> or <Ctrl>
               key down like <Shift> while typing and releasing <key>, then
               releasing <Control>. ^<key> is used as  shorthand  elsewhere
               in the Guidebook to mean the same thing.  Control characters
               are case-insensitive so ^x and ^X are the same.

          M[yuhjklbn]
               Old versions supported `M' as a movement prefix  which  com-
               bined the effect of `m' with <Control>+<direction>.  That is
               no longer supported as a prefix but similar  effect  can  be
               achieved  by  using  `m' and G<direction> in combination.  m
               can also be used in  combination  with  g<direction>,  <Con-
               trol>+<direction>, or <Shift>+<direction>.

          _    Travel to a map location via a shortest-path algorithm.

               The  shortest  path  is computed over map locations the hero
               knows about (e.g. seen or previously traversed).   If  there
               is no known path, a guess is made instead.  Stops on most of
               the same conditions as the `G' prefix, but  without  picking
               up  objects, so implicitly forces the `m' prefix.  For ports
               with mouse support, the  command  is  also  invoked  when  a
               mouse-click takes place on a location other than the current
               position.

          .    Wait or rest, do nothing for one turn.  Precede with the `m'
               prefix to wait for a turn even next to a hostile monster, if
               safe_wait is on.

          a    Apply (use) a tool (pick-axe, key, lamp...).

               If used on a wand, that wand will be broken,  releasing  its
               magic in the process.  Confirmation is required.

          A    Remove one or more worn items, such as armor.

               Use  `T'  (take  off) to take off only one piece of armor or
               `R' (remove) to take off only one accessory.

          ^A   Repeat the previous command.

          c    Close a door.

          C    Call (name) a monster, an individual object, or  a  type  of
               object.

               Same as extended command "#name".

          ^C   Panic button.  Quit the game.

          d    Drop something.

               For example "d7a" means drop seven items of object a.

          D    Drop several things.

               In answer to the question

               "What kinds of things do you want to drop? [!%= BUCXPaium]"

               you  should  type  zero or more object symbols possibly fol-
               lowed by `a' and/or `i' and/or `u' and/or `m'.  In addition,
               one  or  more  of  the blessed/uncursed/cursed groups may be
               typed.

               DB  - drop all objects known to be blessed.
               DU  - drop all objects known to be uncursed.
               DC  - drop all objects known to be cursed.
               DX  - drop all objects of unknown B/U/C status.
               DP  - drop objects picked up last.
               Da  - drop all objects, without asking for confirmation.
               Di  - examine your inventory before dropping anything.
               Du  - drop only unpaid objects (when in a shop).
               Dm  - use a menu to pick which object(s) to drop.
               D%u - drop only unpaid food.

               The last example shows a combination.  There are four  cate-
               gories  of object filtering: class (`!' for potions, `?' for
               scrolls, and so on), shop status (`u' for unpaid,  in  other
               words, owned by the shop), bless/curse state (`B', `U', `C',
               and `X' as shown above), and novelty (`P',  recently  picked
               up items; controlled by picking up or dropping things rather
               than by any time factor).

               If you specify more than one value in a  category  (such  as
               "!?"  for  potions  and  scrolls or "BU" for blessed and un-
               cursed), an inventory object will meet the  criteria  if  it
               matches  any  of  the specified values (so "!?" means `!' or
               `?').  If you specify more than one category,  an  inventory
               object  must  meet  each  of  the category criteria (so "%u"
               means class `%' and unpaid `u').  Lastly,  you  may  specify
               multiple  values within multiple categories: "!?BU" will se-
               lect all potions and scrolls which are known to  be  blessed
               or uncursed.  (In versions prior to 3.6, filter combinations
               behaved differently.)

               Normally checks for edible item(s) on  the  floor,  then  if
               none are found or none are chosen, checks for edible item(s)
               in inventory.  Precede `e' with the `m' prefix to bypass at-
               tempting to eat anything off the floor.

               If  you  attempt  to  eat  while already satiated, you might
               choke to death.  If you risk it, you will be  asked  whether
               to  "continue  eating?"  if you survive the first bite.  You
               can set the paranoid_confirmation:eating option to require a
               response of yes instead of just y.

          E    Engrave a message on the floor.

                    E- - write in the dust with your fingers.

               Engraving  the  word  "Elbereth" will cause most monsters to
               not attack you hand-to-hand (but if you attack, you will rub
               it out); this is often useful to give yourself a breather.

          f    Fire  (shoot  or  throw)  one  of the objects placed in your
               quiver (or quiver sack, or that you have at the ready).  You
               may  select  ammunition  with a previous `Q' command, or let
               the computer pick something  appropriate  if  autoquiver  is
               true.  If your wielded weapon has the throw-and-return prop-
               erty, your quiver is empty, and  autoquiver  is  false,  you
               will  throw  that  wielded  weapon  instead  of  filling the
               quiver.  This will  also  automatically  use  a  polearm  if
               wielded.   If  fireassist is true, firing will automatically
               try to wield a launcher (for example,  a  bow  or  a  sling)
               matching  the  ammo  in the quiver; this might take multiple
               turns, and get interrupted by a monster.  Remember  to  swap
               back to your main melee weapon afterwards.

               See also `t' (throw) for more general throwing and shooting.

          i    List your inventory (everything you're carrying).

          I    List selected parts of your inventory, usually be specifying
               the character for a particular set of objects, like `['  for
               armor or `!' for potions.

               I* - list all gems in inventory;
               Iu - list all unpaid items;
               Ix - list all used up items that are on your shopping bill;

          O    Set options.

               A  menu showing the current option values will be displayed.
               You can change most values simply by selecting the menu  en-
               try for the given option (ie, by typing its letter or click-
               ing upon it, depending on your  user  interface).   For  the
               non-boolean  choices,  a  further menu or prompt will appear
               once you've closed this menu.   The  available  options  are
               listed later in this Guidebook.  Options are usually set be-
               fore the game rather than with the `O' command; see the sec-
               tion  on  options below.  Precede `O' with the `m' prefix to
               show advanced options.

          ^O   Show overview.

               Shortcut for "#overview":  list interesting  dungeon  levels
               visited.

               (Prior  to 3.6.0, `^O' was a debug mode command which listed
               the placement of all special levels.  Use "#wizwhere" to run
               that command.)

          p    Pay your shopping bill.

          P    Put on an accessory (ring, amulet, or blindfold).

               This command may also be used to wear armor.  The prompt for
               which inventory item to use will only list accessories,  but
               choosing  an unlisted item of armor will attempt to wear it.
               (See the `W' command below.  It lists armor as the inventory
               choices but will accept an accessory and attempt to put that
               on.)

          ^P   Repeat previous message.

               Subsequent `^P's repeat earlier messages.  For  some  inter-
               faces, the behavior can be varied via the msg_window option.

          q    Quaff (drink) something (potion, water, etc).

               When there is a fountain or sink present, it asks whether to
               drink from that.  If that is  declined,  then  it  offers  a
               chance  to choose a potion from inventory.  Precede `q' with
               the `m' prefix to skip asking about drinking from a fountain
               or sink.

          Q    Select  an object for your quiver, quiver sack, or just gen-
               erally at the ready (only one of these  is  available  at  a
               time).   You can then throw this (or one of these) using the
               `f' command.

          r    Read a scroll or spellbook.




          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023

          R    Remove a worn accessory (ring, amulet, or blindfold).

               If you're wearing more than  one,  you'll  be  prompted  for
               which  one to remove.  When you're only wearing one, then by
               default it will be removed without asking, but you  can  set
               the paranoid_confirmation option to require a prompt.

               This command may also be used to take off armor.  The prompt
               for which inventory item to remove only  lists  worn  acces-
               sories,  but  an item of worn armor can be chosen.  (See the
               `T' command below.  It lists armor as the inventory  choices
               but will accept an accessory and attempt to remove it.)

          ^R   Redraw the screen.

          s    Search  for  secret  doors and traps around you.  It usually
               takes several tries to find something.  Precede with the `m'
               prefix  to search for a turn even next to a hostile monster,
               if safe_wait is on.

               Can also be used to figure out whether there is still a mon-
               ster at an adjacent "remembered, unseen monster" marker.

          S    Save  the  game (which suspends play and exits the program).
               The saved game will be restored automatically the next  time
               you play using the same character name.

               In  normal play, once a saved game is restored the file used
               to hold the saved data is deleted.  In  explore  mode,  once
               restoration is accomplished you are asked whether to keep or
               delete the file.  Keeping the file makes it feasible to play
               for  a  while  then  quit  without  saving and later restore
               again.

               There is no "save current game state and keep playing"  com-
               mand, not even in explore mode where saved game files can be
               kept and re-used.

          t    Throw an object or shoot a projectile.

               There's no separate "shoot" command.  If you throw an  arrow
               while  wielding  a  bow, you are shooting that arrow and any
               weapon skill bonus or penalty for bow applies.  If you throw
               an  arrow  while  not wielding a bow, you are throwing it by
               hand and it will generally be less effective than when shot.

               See also `f' (fire) for throwing or shooting an item pre-se-
               lected via the `Q' (quiver) command, with some extra assist-
               ance.

          T    Take off armor.

               If you're wearing more than one piece,  you'll  be  prompted
               for  which  one to take off.  (Note that this treats a cloak

               covering a suit and/or a shirt, or a suit covering a  shirt,
               as if the underlying items weren't there.)  When you're only
               wearing one, then by default it will be  taken  off  without
               asking,  but you can set the paranoid_confirmation option to
               require a prompt.

               This command may also be used to  remove  accessories.   The
               prompt  for which inventory item to take off only lists worn
               armor, but a worn accessory can be  chosen.   (See  the  `R'
               command  above.   It  lists  accessories  as  the  inventory
               choices but will accept an item of armor and attempt to take
               it off.)

               Some  characters  can wield two weapons at once; use the `X'
               command (or the "#twoweapon" extended command) to do so.

          W    Wear armor.

               This command may also be used to put on an accessory  (ring,
               amulet,  or blindfold).  The prompt for which inventory item
               to use will only list armor, but choosing an unlisted acces-
               sory will attempt to put it on.  (See the `P' command above.
               It lists accessories as the inventory choices but  will  ac-
               cept an item of armor and attempt to wear it.)

          x    Exchange your wielded weapon with the item in your alternate
               weapon slot.

               The latter is used as your secondary weapon when engaging in
               two-weapon  combat.   Note  that  if  one  of these slots is
               empty, the exchange still takes place.

          +    List the spells you know.

               Using this command, you can  also  rearrange  the  order  in
               which  your  spells are listed, either by sorting the entire
               list or by picking one spell from the menu then picking  an-
               other  to  swap  places  with  it.  Swapping pairs of spells
               changes their casting letters, so the change lasts after the

               and then  pick  "reassign  casting  letters".   (Any  spells
               learned  after  that  will  be  added to the end of the list

               As  you can see, the authors of NetHack used up all the let-
          ters, so this is a way to introduce the less frequently used com-
          mands.  What extended commands are available depends on what fea-
          tures the game was compiled with.

          #adjust
               Adjust inventory letters (most useful when the fixinv option
               is "on").  Autocompletes.  Default key is `M-a'.

               This  command allows you to move an item from one particular
               inventory slot to another so that it has a letter  which  is
               more meaningful for you or that it will appear in a particu-
               lar location when inventory listings are displayed.  You can
               move to a currently empty slot, or if the destination is oc-
               cupied--and won't merge--the item there will swap slots with
               the  one being moved.  "#adjust" can also be used to split a
               stack of objects; when choosing the item to adjust, enter  a
               count prior to its letter.

               Adjusting  without  a  count  used to collect all compatible
               stacks when moving to the destination.   That  behavior  has
               been changed; to gather compatible stacks, "#adjust" a stack
               into its own inventory slot.  If it  has  a  name  assigned,
               other  stacks  with the same name or with no name will merge
               provided that all their other attributes match.  If it  does
               not  have  a name, only other stacks with no name are eligi-
               ble.  In either case, otherwise  compatible  stacks  with  a
               different  name will not be merged.  This contrasts with us-
               ing "#adjust" to move from one slot to a different slot.  In
               that  situation,  moving (no count given) a compatible stack
               will merge if either stack has a name when the other doesn't
               and  give  that  name  to the result, while splitting (count
               given) will ignore the source  stack's  name  when  deciding
               whether to merge with the destination stack.

          #annotate
               Allows you to specify one line of text to associate with the
               current dungeon level.  All levels with annotations are dis-
               played  by the "#overview" command.  Autocompletes.  Default

               Default key is `a'.

               If  the  tool used acts on items on the floor, using the `m'
               prefix skips those items.

               If used on a wand, that wand will be broken,  releasing  its
               magic in the process.  Confirmation is required.

          #offer
               Offer a sacrifice to the gods.  Autocompletes.  Default  key
               is `M-o'.

               You'll  need to find an altar to have any chance at success.
               Corpses of  recently  killed  monsters  are  the  fodder  of
               choice.

               The `m' prefix skips offering any items which are on the al-
               tar.

          #open
               Open a door.  Default key is `o'.

          #options

               cede with the `m' prefix to execute the simpler options com-
               mand.   (Mainly  useful  if you use BINDING=O:optionsfull to
               switch `O' from simple options back to traditional  advanced
               options.)

          #overview
               Display  information  you've  discovered  about the dungeon.
               Any visited level (unless forgotten due to amnesia) with  an
               annotation  is  included,  and many things (altars, thrones,
               fountains, and so on; extra stairs leading to  another  dun-
               geon  branch)  trigger  an automatic annotation.  If dungeon
               overview is chosen during end-of-game disclosure, every vis-
               ited  level will be included regardless of annotations.  Au-
               tocompletes.  Default keys are `^O', and `M-O'.

          #panic
               Test the panic routine.  Terminates the current game.  Auto-
               completes.  Debug mode only.

               Asks  for confirmation; default is n (no); continue playing.
               To really panic, respond with y.   You  can  set  the  para-
               noid_confirmation:quit  option  to require a response of yes
               instead.

          #pay
               Pay your shopping bill.  Default key is `p'.

          #perminv
               If persistent inventory display  is  supported  and  enabled
               (with  the  perm_invent option), interact with it instead of
               with the map.  You'll be prompted for  menu  scrolling  key-
               strokes  such as `>' and `<'.  Press Return or Escape to re-
               sume normal play.  Default key is `|'.

          #pickup
               Pick up things at the current location.  Default key is `,'.
               The `m' prefix forces use of a menu.

          #polyself
               Polymorph self.  Autocompletes.  Debug mode only.

          #pray
               Pray  to  the gods for help.  Autocompletes.  Default key is
               `M-p'.

               Praying too soon after receiving prior help is a  bad  idea.
               (Hint:  entering  the dungeon alive is treated as having re-
               ceived help.  You probably shouldn't start off a new game by
               praying  right  away.)  Since using this command by accident
               can cause trouble, there is an option to  make  you  confirm
               your  intent  before praying.  It is enabled by default, and
               you can reset the paranoid_confirmation  option  to  disable
               it.

          #prevmsg
               Show  previously  displayed  game  messages.  Default key is
               `^P'.

               Put on an accessory (ring, amulet,  etc).   Default  key  is
               `P'.

          #quaff
               Quaff (drink) something.  Default key is `q'.

               The  `m'  prefix  skips  drinking from a fountain or sink if
               there is one at your location.

          #quit
               Quit the program without saving your game.  Autocompletes.

               Since using this command by accident would  throw  away  the
               current  game,  you  are asked to confirm your intent before
               quitting.  Default response is n (no); continue playing.  To
               really  quit, respond with y.  You can set the paranoid_con-
               firmation:quit option to require a response of yes instead.

          #quiver
               Select ammunition for quiver.  Default key is `Q'.

          #read
               Read a scroll, a spellbook, or something else.  Default  key
               is `r'.

               Redraw  the  screen.   Default key is `^R', and also `^L' if
               number_pad is on.

               commands.  Prevents autopickup when used with movement  com-

               when  number_pad  is off, `5' when number_pad is set to 1 or
               3, otherwise `M-5' when it is set to 2 or 4.

          #rush
               Prefix key to rush towards a direction.  Default is `g' when
               number_pad  is  off, `M-5' when number_pad is set to 1 or 3,
               otherwise `5' when it is set to 2 or 4.

          #save
               Save the game and exit the program.  Default key is `S'.

          #saveoptions
               Save configuration options to the config  file.   This  will
               overwrite  the  file,  removing all comments, so if you have
               manually edited the config file, don't use this.

               system configuration file.  Use the shell command `exit'  to
               return to the game.  Default key is `!'.

          #showgold
               Report  the  gold in your inventory, including gold you know
               about in containers you're carrying.  If you  are  inside  a
               shop,  report any credit or debt you have in that shop.  De-
               fault key is `$'.

          #showspells
               List and reorder known spells.  Default key is `+'.

          #showtrap
               Describe an adjacent trap, possibly covered by objects or  a
               monster.   To  be eligible, the trap must already be discov-
               ered.  (The "#terrain" command can display your map with all
               objects and monsters temporarily removed, making it possible
               to see all discovered traps.)  Default key is `^'.

          #sit
               Sit down.  Autocompletes.  Default key is `M-s'.

          #stats

               only.

          #suspend
               Suspend  the game, switching from NetHack to the terminal it
               was started from without performing save-and-exit.   Can  be
               disabled  at  the  time the program is built.  When enabled,
               mainly useful for tty and curses interfaces  on  UNIX.   Use
               the  shell  command `fg' to return to the game.  Default key
               is `^Z'.

          #swap
               Swap wielded and secondary weapons.  Default key is `x'.

          #takeoffall
               Remove all armor.  Default key is `A'.

          #teleport
               Teleport around the level.  Default key is `^T'.

          #terrain
               Show map without obstructions.  In normal play you can  view
               the explored portion of the current level's map without mon-
               sters; without monsters and objects;  or  without  monsters,
               objects, and traps.

               In  explore mode, you can choose to view the full map rather
               than just its explored portion.  In debug mode there are ad-
               ditional choices.

               Autocompletes.   Default  key  is `<del>' or `<delete>' (see
               Del above).

          #therecmdmenu
               Show a menu of possible actions directed at a location  next
               to  you.   The  menu is limited to a subset of the likeliest
               actions, not an exhaustive set of all possibilities.   Auto-
               completes.

          #throw
               Throw something.  Default key is `t'.

          #timeout
               Look at the timeout queue.  Autocompletes.  Debug mode only.

          #tip
               Tip  over a container (bag or box) to pour out its contents.
               When there are containers on the floor, the game will prompt
               to  pick  one  of them or "tip something being carried".  If
               the latter is chosen, there will be another prompt for which
               item from inventory to tip.

               The  `m'  prefix  makes  the  command skip containers on the
               floor and pick one from inventory, except  for  the  special
               case  of  menustyle:traditional  with two or more containers
               present; that situation will start with the floor  container
               menu.

               Autocompletes.  Default key is `M-T'.

          #travel
               Travel  to  a  specific location on the map.  Default key is
               `_'.  Using the "request menu" prefix shows a menu of inter-
               esting  targets  in sight without asking to move the cursor.
               When picking a target with cursor and the  autodescribe  op-
               tion  is  on,  the  top line will show "(no travel path)" if
               your character does not know of a  path  to  that  location.

          #turn
               Turn undead away.  Autocompletes.  Default key is `M-t'.

          #twoweapon
               Toggle two-weapon combat on or off.  Autocompletes.  Default
               key is `X', and also `M-2' if number_pad is off.

               Note that you must use suitable weapons  for  this  type  of
               combat, or it will be automatically turned off.

          #untrap
               Untrap something (trap, door, or chest).  Default key is `M-
               u', and `u' if number_pad is on.

               In some circumstances it can also be used to rescue  trapped
               monsters.

          #up
               Go up a staircase.  Default key is `<'.

          #vanquished
               List vanquished monsters by type and count.

               Note that the vanquished monsters list includes all monsters
               killed by traps and each other as well as by you, and  omits
               any  which  got  removed  from the game without being killed
               (perhaps by genocide, or by a mollified shopkeeper  dismiss-
               ing  summoned  Kops)  or were already corpses when placed on
               the map.

               Using the "request menu" prefix prior to #vanquished  brings
               up  a  menu  of  sorting orders available (provided that the
               vanquished monsters list contains at least two types of mon-
               sters).   Whichever  ordering is picked gets assigned to the
               sortvanquished option so is remembered for subsequent  #van-
               quished requests.  During end-of-game disclosure, when asked
               whether to show vanquished monsters answering `a'  will  let
               you choose from the sort menu.

               Autocompletes.  Default key is `M-V'.

          #version
               Print compile time options for this version of NetHack.

               The  second  paragraph  lists the user interface(s) that are
               included.  If there are more than one, you can use the  win-
               dowtype option in your run-time configuration file to select
               the one you want.

               Autocompletes.  Default key is `M-v'.

          #versionshort

               If your keyboard has a meta key (which, when pressed in com-
          bination  with  another  key,  modifies  it by setting the "meta"
          [8th, or "high"] bit), you can invoke many extended  commands  by
          meta-ing the first letter of the command.



          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              32



               On  Windows  and  MS-DOS,  the "Alt" key can be used in this
          fashion.  On other systems, if  typing  "Alt"  plus  another  key
          transmits  a  two character sequence consisting of an Escape fol-
          lowed by the other key, you may set the altmeta  option  to  have
          NetHack  combine  them  into  meta+<key>.  (This combining action
          only takes place when NetHack is expecting a command to  execute,
          not when accepting input to name something or to make a wish.)

               Unlike  control  characters, where ^x and ^X denote the same
          thing, meta characters are case-sensitive:  M-x and M-X represent
          different  things.   Some  commands  which  can be run via a meta
          character require that the  letter  be  capitalized  because  the
          lower-case  equivalent  is used for another command, so the three
          key combination meta+Shift+<letter> is needed.

          5.  Rooms and corridors

               Rooms  and  corridors in the dungeon are either lit or dark.
          Any lit areas within your line of sight will be  displayed;  dark
          areas  are  only  displayed  if they are within one space of you.
          Walls and corridors remain on the map as you explore them.

               Secret corridors are hidden and appear  to  be  solid  rock.
          You  can find them with the `s' (search) command when adjacent to
          them.  Multiple search attempts may be needed.  When searching is
          successful,  secret corridors become ordinary open corridor loca-
          tions.  Mapping magic reveals secret corridors, so converts  them
          into ordinary corridors and shows them as such.

          5.1.  Doorways

               Doorways connect rooms and corridors.  Some doorways have no
          doors; you can walk right through.  Others have  doors  in  them,


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              34



          which may be open, closed, or locked.  To open a closed door, use
          the `o' (open) command; to close it again, use  the  `c'  (close)
          command.   By  default  the autoopen option is enabled, so simply
          attempting to walk onto a closed door's location will attempt  to
          open  it without needing `o'.  Opening via autoopen will not work
          if you are confused or stunned or suffer from the fumbling attri-
          bute.

               Open  doors  cannot be entered diagonally; you must approach
          them straight on, horizontally or vertically.   Doorways  without
          doors are not restricted in this fashion except on one particular
          level (described by "#overview" as "a primitive area").

               Unlocking magic exists but usually won't be available  early
          on.  You can get through a locked door without magic by first us-
          ing an unlocking tool with the  `a'  (apply)  command,  and  then
          opening it.  By default the autounlock option is also enabled, so
          if you attempt to open (via `o' or autoopen) a locked door  while
          carrying  an unlocking tool, you'll be asked whether to use it on
          the door's lock.  Alternatively, you  can  break  a  closed  door
          (whether  locked  or  not) down by kicking it via the `^D' (kick)
          command.  Kicking down a door destroys it  and  makes  a  lot  of
          noise which might wake sleeping monsters.

               Some  closed  doors are booby-trapped and will explode if an
          attempt is made to open (when unlocked) or unlock  (when  locked)
          or  kick  down.  Like kicking, an explosion destroys the door and
          makes a lot of noise.  The  "#untrap"  command  can  be  used  to
          search  a door for traps but might take multiple attempts to find
          one.  When one is found, you'll be asked whether to try to disarm
          it.   If  you accede, success will eliminate the trap but failure
          will set off the trap's explosion.  (If you decline,  you  effec-
          tively forget that a trap was found there.)

               Closed  doors can be useful for shutting out monsters.  Most
          monsters cannot open closed doors, although a few don't  need  to
          (for  example,  ghosts  can walk through doors and fog clouds can
          flow under them).  Some monsters who can open doors can also  use
          unlocking tools.  And some (giants) can smash doors.

               Secret doors are hidden and appear to be ordinary wall (from
          inside a room) or solid rock (from outside).  You can  find  them
          with  the  `s'  (search) command but it might take multiple tries
          (possibly many tries if your luck is poor).  Once found they  are
          in  all  ways equivalent to normal doors.  Mapping magic does not
          reveal secret doors.

          5.2.  Traps (`^')

               There are traps throughout the dungeon to snare  the  unwary
          intruder.   For  example, you may suddenly fall into a pit and be
          stuck for a few turns trying to climb out (see  below).   A  trap
          usually  won't  appear on your map until you trigger it by moving
          onto it, you see someone else trigger it, or you discover it with


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              35



          the  `s' (search) command (multiple attempts are often needed; if
          your luck is poor, many attempts might be needed).  Wands of  se-
          cret  door detection and spell of detect unseen also reveal traps
          within a modest radius but only if the trap is also within  line-
          of-sight (whether you can see at the time or not).  There is also
          other magic which can reveal traps.

               Monsters can fall prey to traps, too, which can  potentially
          be  used  as  a  defensive  strategy.  Unfortunately traps can be
          harmful to your pet(s) as well.  Monsters, including  pets,  usu-
          ally  will avoid moving onto a trap which is shown on your map if
          they have encountered that type of trap before.

               Some traps such as pits, bear traps, and webs  hold  you  in
          one  place.   You can escape by simply trying to move to an adja-
          cent spot and repeat as needed; eventually you will get free.

               Other traps can send  you  to  different  locations.   Tele-
          porters  send  you  elsewhere  on  the same dungeon level.  Level
          teleporters send you to a random dungeon level,  the  destination
          chosen  from  a  few  levels lower all the way to the top.  These
          traps choose a new destination each time they're activated.  Trap
          doors  and holes also send you to another level, but one which is
          always below the current level.  Usually that will  be  the  next
          level  down  but  it can be farther.  Unlike (level) teleporters,
          the destination level of a particular trap door or hole  is  per-
          sistent,  so  falling  into  one will bring you to the same level
          each time--though not necessarily the same  spot  on  the  level.
          Magic  portals  behave similarly, but with some additional varia-
          tion.  Some portals are two-way and their remote  destination  is
          always  the same: another portal which can take you back.  Others
          are one-way and send you to a specific destination level but  not
          necessarily to a specific location there.

               There  is  a  special multi-level branch of the dungeon with
          pre-mapped levels based on the classic computer  game  "Sokoban."
          In that game, you operate as a warehouse worker who pushes crates
          around obstacles to position them at  designated  locations.   In
          NetHack,  the  goal  is to push boulders into pits or holes until
          those traps have all been nullified, giving access to whatever is
          beyond  them.  In the Sokoban game, you can only move in the four
          cardinal compass directions, and a crate in its final destination
          blocks  further  access  to  that spot.  In the Sokoban levels of
          NetHack, you can move diagonally (unless that would let you  pass
          between  two neighboring boulders) but you can only push boulders
          in the four cardinal directions, and a boulder which fills a  pit
          or  hole removes both the boulder and the trap so opens up normal
          access to that spot.  With careful foresight, it is  possible  to
          complete  all of the levels according to the traditional rules of
          Sokoban.  (Hint: to solve Sokoban puzzles, you often need to move
          things  away from their eventual destinations in order to open up
          more room to maneuver.)  Since NetHack does not support  an  undo
          capability,  some allowances are permitted in case you get stuck.
          For example, each level has at least one extra boulder.  Also, it


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              36



          is  possible  to  drop  everything in order to be able to squeeze
          into the same location as a boulder  (and  then  presumably  move
          past it), or to destroy a boulder with magic or tools, or to cre-
          ate new boulders with a scroll of  earth.   However,  doing  such
          things  will  lower  your luck without any specific message given
          about that.  See the Conduct section for information  about  get-
          ting feedback for your actions in Sokoban.

          5.3.  Stairs and ladders (`<', `>')

               In  general, each level in the dungeon will have a staircase
          going up (`<') to the previous level and another going down (`>')
          to  the  next  level.  There are some exceptions though.  For in-
          stance, fairly early in the dungeon you will find  a  level  with
          two  down  staircases,  one  continuing  into the dungeon and the
          other branching into an area known as the Gnomish  Mines.   Those
          mines  eventually hit a dead end, so after exploring them (if you
          choose to do so), you'll need to climb back up to the  main  dun-
          geon.

               When  you  traverse a set of stairs, or trigger a trap which
          sends you to another level, the level you're leaving will be  de-
          activated  and  stored  in a file on disk.  If you're moving to a
          previously visited level, it will be loaded from its file on disk
          and  reactivated.   If you're moving to a level which has not yet
          been visited, it will be created (from scratch  for  most  random
          levels, from a template for some "special" levels, or loaded from
          the remains of an earlier game for a "bones" level as briefly de-
          scribed  below).   Monsters are only active on the current level;
          those on other levels are essentially placed into stasis.

               Ordinarily when you climb a set of stairs, you  will  arrive
          on  the  corresponding  staircase  at your destination.  However,
          pets (see below) and some other monsters  will  follow  along  if
          they're close enough when you travel up or down stairs, and occa-
          sionally one of these creatures  will  displace  you  during  the
          climb.  When that occurs, the pet or other monster will arrive on
          the staircase and you will end up nearby.

               Ladders serve the same purpose as staircases,  and  the  two
          types  of  inter-level  connections  are nearly indistinguishable
          during game play.

          5.4.  Shops and shopping

               Occasionally you will run across a room  with  a  shopkeeper
          near  the  door  and  many items lying on the floor.  You can buy
          items by picking them up and then using the `p' command.  You can
          inquire  about the price of an item prior to picking it up by us-
          ing the "#chat" command while standing  on  it.   Using  an  item
          prior  to  paying  for it will incur a charge, and the shopkeeper
          won't allow you to leave the shop until you have  paid  any  debt
          you owe.



          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              37



               You  can  sell items to a shopkeeper by dropping them to the
          floor while inside a shop.  You will either be offered an  amount
          of  gold  and  asked whether you're willing to sell, or you'll be
          told that the shopkeeper isn't interested (generally,  your  item
          needs  to  be  compatible with the type of merchandise carried by
          the shop).

               If you drop something in a shop by accident, the  shopkeeper
          will  usually  claim ownership without offering any compensation.
          You'll have to buy it back if you want to reclaim it.

               Shopkeepers sometime run out of money.  When  that  happens,
          you'll  be  offered  credit  instead of gold when you try to sell
          something.  Credit can be used to pay for purchases,  but  it  is
          only  good  in  the shop where it was obtained; other shopkeepers
          won't honor it.  (If you happen to find a "credit  card"  in  the
          dungeon, don't bother trying to use it in shops; shopkeepers will
          not accept it.)

               The `$' command, which reports the amount of  gold  you  are
          carrying,  will  also  show  current shop debt or credit, if any.
          The "Iu" command lists unpaid items (those which still belong  to
          the shop) if you are carrying any.  The "Ix" command shows an in-
          ventory-like display of any unpaid items which have been used up,
          along with other shop fees, if any.

          5.4.1.  Shop idiosyncrasies

               Several aspects of shop behavior might be unexpected.

          * The price of a given item can vary due to a variety of factors.

          * A  shopkeeper treats the spot immediately inside the door as if
            it were outside the shop.

          * While the shopkeeper watches you like a hawk, he  or  she  will
            generally ignore any other customers.

          * If  a  shop  is "closed for inventory," it will not open of its
            own accord.

          * Shops do not get restocked with new items, regardless of inven-
            tory depletion.

          5.5.  Movement feedback

               Moving  around  the  map usually provides no feedback--other
          than drawing the hero at the new location--unless you step on  an
          object  or pile of objects, or on a trap, or attempt to move onto
          a spot where a monster is located.   There  are  several  options
          which can be used to augment the normal feedback.

               The  pile_limit option controls how many objects can be in a
          pile--sharing the same map location--for the game to state "there


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              38



          are  objects  here"  instead  of listing them.  The default is 5.
          Setting it to 1 would always give that message instead of listing
          any objects.  Setting it to 0 is a special case which will always
          list all objects no matter how big a pile is.  Note that the num-
          ber  refers  to  the  count of separate stacks of objects present
          rather than the sum of the quantities of those stacks (so  7  ar-
          rows  or 25 gold pieces will each count as 1 rather than as 7 and
          25, respectively, and total to 2 when both are at the same  loca-
          tion).

               The  "nopickup" command prefix (default `m') can be used be-
          fore a movement direction to step on objects  without  attempting
          auto-pickup and without giving feedback about them.

               The  mention_walls  option controls whether you get feedback
          if you try to walk into a wall or solid stone or off the edge  of
          the  map.  Normally nothing happens (unless the hero is blind and
          no wall is shown, then the wall that is being bumped into will be
          drawn  on the map).  This option also gives feedback when rushing
          or running stops for some non-obvious reason.

               The mention_decor option controls whether you  get  feedback
          when  walking on "furniture."  Normally stepping onto stairs or a
          fountain or an altar or various other things doesn't elicit  any-
          thing  unless it is covered by one or more objects so is obscured
          on the map.  Setting this  option  to  true  will  describe  such
          things  even  when  they  aren't obscured.  Doorless doorways and
          open doors aren't considered worthy of mention; closed doors  (if
          you  can  move  onto their spots) and broken doors are.  Assuming
          that you're able to do so, moving onto water or lava or ice  will
          give  feedback  if not yet on that type of terrain but not repeat
          it (unless there has been some intervening message)  when  moving
          from water to another water spot, or lava to lava, or ice to ice.
          Moving off of any of those back onto "normal" terrain  will  give
          one  message  too, unless there is feedback about one or more ob-
          jects, in which case the back on land circumstance is implied.

               The confirm and safe_pet options control what  happens  when
          you  try  to  move onto a peaceful monster's spot or a tame one's
          spot.

               The "nopickup" command prefix  (default  `m')  is  also  the
          move-without-attacking prefix and can be used to try to step onto
          a visible monster's spot without the move being considered an at-
          tack  (see  the  Fighting  subsection  of  Monsters  below).  The
          "fight" command prefix (default `F'; also `-'  if  number_pad  is
          on) can be used to force an attack, when guessing where an unseen
          monster is or when deliberately  attacking  a  peaceful  or  tame
          creature.

               The run_mode option controls how frequently the map gets re-
          drawn when moving more than one step in a single command (so when
          rushing, running, or traveling).



          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023

          5.6.  Rogue level

               One  dungeon  level  (occurring  in mid to late teens of the
          main dungeon) is a tribute to the ancestor game  hack's  inspira-
          tion rogue.

               It  is usually displayed differently from other levels: pos-
          sibly in characters instead of  tiles,  or  without  line-drawing
          symbols if already in characters; also, gold is shown as * rather
          than $ and stairs are shown as % rather than < and >.  There  are
          some  minor differences in actual game play: doorways lack doors;
          a scroll, wand, or spell of light used in a room  lights  up  the
          whole  room  rather  than  within a radius around your character.
          And monsters represented by lower-case  letters  aren't  randomly
          generated on the rogue level.

               The  slight  strangeness  of  this level is a feature, not a
          bug....

          6.  Monsters

               Monsters you cannot see are not  displayed  on  the  screen.
          Beware!   You  may  suddenly come upon one in a dark place.  Some
          magic items can help you  locate  them  before  they  locate  you
          (which some monsters can do very well).

               The  commands  `/' and `;' may be used to obtain information
          about those monsters who are displayed on the screen.   The  com-
          mand  "#name"  (by  default bound to `C'), allows you to assign a
          name to a monster, which may be useful to  help  distinguish  one
          from  another  when  multiple  monsters are present.  Assigning a
          name which is just a space will remove any prior name.

               The extended command "#chat" can be used to interact with an
          adjacent monster.  There is no actual dialog (in other words, you
          don't get to choose what you'll say), but chatting with some mon-
          sters  such  as  a shopkeeper or the Oracle of Delphi can produce
          useful results.

          6.1.  Fighting

               If you see a monster and you wish to fight it, just  attempt
          to  walk  into  it.   Many  monsters you find will mind their own
          business unless you attack them.  Some of them are very dangerous
          when angered.  Remember:  discretion is the better part of valor.

               In  most  circumstances, if you attempt to attack a peaceful
          monster by moving into its location, you'll be asked  to  confirm
          your  intent.   By default an answer of `y' acknowledges that in-
          tent, which can be error prone if you're using `y' to move.   You
          can set the paranoid_confirmation option to require a response of
          "yes" instead.




          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              40



               If you can't see a monster (if it is invisible,  or  if  you
          are  blinded), the symbol `I' will be shown when you learn of its
          presence.  If you attempt to walk into it, you will try to  fight
          it  just  like a monster that you can see; of course, if the mon-
          ster has moved, you will attack empty air.  If you guess that the
          monster  has  moved  and you don't wish to fight, you can use the
          `m' command to move without fighting; likewise, if you don't  re-
          member a monster but want to try fighting anyway, you can use the
          `F' command.

          6.2.  Your pet

               You start the game with a little dog (`d'), kitten (`f'), or
          pony  (`u'),  which follows you about the dungeon and fights mon-
          sters with you.  Like you, your pet needs food to survive.   Dogs
          and  cats  usually  feed  themselves  on  fresh carrion and other
          meats; horses need vegetarian food which is harder  to  come  by.
          If  you're  worried  about  your pet or want to train it, you can
          feed it, too, by throwing it food.  A properly trained pet can be
          very useful under certain circumstances.

               Your  pet  also  gains experience from killing monsters, and
          can grow over time, gaining hit points  and  doing  more  damage.
          Initially,  your  pet  may  even be better at killing things than
          you, which makes pets useful for low-level characters.

               Your pet will follow you up and down  staircases  if  it  is
          next  to  you when you move.  Otherwise your pet will be stranded
          and may become wild.  Similarly, when you trigger  certain  types
          of  traps  which  alter  your location (for instance, a trap door
          which drops you to a lower dungeon level), any adjacent pet  will
          accompany you and any non-adjacent pet will be left behind.  Your
          pet may trigger such traps itself; you will not be carried  along
          with it even if adjacent at the time.

          6.3.  Steeds

               Some  types of creatures in the dungeon can actually be rid-
          den if you have the right equipment and skill.  Convincing a wild
          beast  to  let  you  saddle  it up is difficult to say the least.
          Many a dungeoneer has had to resort to magic and wizardry in  or-
          der to forge the alliance.  Once you do have the beast under your
          control however, you can easily climb in and out  of  the  saddle
          with the "#ride" command.  Lead the beast around the dungeon when
          riding, in the same manner as you would move yourself.  It is the
          beast that you will see displayed on the map.

               Riding  skill is managed by the "#enhance" command.  See the
          section on Weapon proficiency for more information about that.

               Use the `a' (apply) command and pick a saddle in your inven-
          tory  to  attempt to put that saddle on an adjacent creature.  If
          successful, it will be transferred to that creature's inventory.

               Use the "#loot" command while adjacent to a saddled creature
          to  try  to remove the saddle from that creature.  If successful,
          it will be transferred to your inventory.

          6.4.  Bones levels

               You may encounter the shades and corpses of other  adventur-
          ers (or even former incarnations of yourself!) and their personal
          effects.  Ghosts are hard to  kill,  but  easy  to  avoid,  since
          they're  slow and do little damage.  You can plunder the deceased
          adventurer's possessions; however, they are likely to be  cursed.
          Beware of whatever killed the former player; it is probably still
          lurking around, gloating over its last victory.

          6.5.  Persistence of Monsters

               Monsters (a generic reference which also includes humans and
          pets)  are only shown while they can be seen or otherwise sensed.
          Moving to a location where you can't see or sense a  monster  any
          more  will  result in it disappearing from your map, similarly if
          it is the one who moved rather than you.

               However, if you encounter a monster which you can't  see  or
          sense--perhaps  it  is  invisible  and has just tapped you on the
          noggin--a special "remembered, unseen  monster"  marker  will  be
          displayed  at the location where you think it is.  That will per-
          sist until you have proven that there is no monster  there,  even
          if  the unseen monster moves to another location or you move to a
          spot where the marker's location ordinarily wouldn't be seen  any
          more.

          7.  Objects

               When you find something in the dungeon, it is common to want
          to pick it up.  In NetHack, this is accomplished by using the `,'
          command.  If autopickup option is on, you will automatically pick
          up the object by walking over, unless you move with the `m'  pre-
          fix.

               If  you're carrying too many items, NetHack will tell you so
          and you won't be able to pick up anything  more.   Otherwise,  it
          will  add  the  object(s) to your pack and tell you what you just
          picked up.

               As you add items to your inventory, you also add the  weight
          of  that  object to your load.  The amount that you can carry de-
          pends on your strength and your constitution.  The  stronger  and
          sturdier  you  are, the less the additional load will affect you.
          There comes a point, though, when the weight of all of that stuff
          you  are carrying around with you through the dungeon will encum-
          ber you.  Your reactions will get slower and you'll burn calories
          faster,  requiring food more frequently to cope with it.  Eventu-
          ally, you'll be so overloaded that you'll either have to  discard
          some of what you're carrying or collapse under its weight.


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              42



               NetHack  will  tell  you how badly you have loaded yourself.
          If you are encumbered, one of the conditions Burdened,  Stressed,
          Strained,  Overtaxed,  or  Overloaded will be shown on the bottom
          line status display.

               When you pick up an object, it is assigned an inventory let-
          ter.   Many commands that operate on objects must ask you to find
          out which object you want to  use.   When  NetHack  asks  you  to
          choose a particular object you are carrying, you are usually pre-
          sented with a list of inventory letters to choose from (see  Com-
          mands, above).

               Some  objects,  such  as weapons, are easily differentiated.
          Others, like scrolls and potions, are  given  descriptions  which
          vary  according to type.  During a game, any two objects with the
          same description are the same type.   However,  the  descriptions
          will vary from game to game.

               When you use one of these objects, if its effect is obvious,
          NetHack will remember what it is for you.  If  its  effect  isn't
          extremely  obvious,  you will be asked what you want to call this
          type of object so you will recognize it later.  You can also  use
          the  "#name"  command,  for the same purpose at any time, to name
          all objects of a particular type or just  an  individual  object.
          When  you  use "#name" on an object which has already been named,
          specifying a space as the value will remove the  prior  name  in-
          stead of assigning a new one.

          7.1.  Curses and Blessings

               Any  object  that you find may be cursed, even if the object
          is otherwise helpful.  The most common effect of a curse is being
          stuck  with (and to) the item.  Cursed weapons weld themselves to
          your hand when wielded, so you cannot unwield them.   Any  cursed
          item  you  wear is not removable by ordinary means.  In addition,
          cursed arms and armor usually, but not always, bear negative  en-
          chantments that make them less effective in combat.  Other cursed
          objects may act poorly or detrimentally in other ways.

               Objects can also be blessed instead.  Blessed items  usually
          work better or more beneficially than normal uncursed items.  For
          example, a blessed weapon will do slightly  more  damage  against
          demons.

               Objects which are neither cursed nor blessed are referred to
          as uncursed.  They could just as easily have  been  described  as
          unblessed,  but  the  uncursed  designation  is what you will see
          within the game.  A "glass half full  versus  glass  half  empty"
          situation; make of that what you will.

               There are magical means of bestowing or removing curses upon
          objects, so even if you are stuck with one, you  can  still  have
          the  curse  lifted and the item removed.  Priests and Priestesses
          have an innate sensitivity to this property  in  any  object,  so


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              43



          they  can  more  easily avoid cursed objects than other character
          roles.  Dropping objects onto an altar will reveal their bless or
          curse state provided that you can see them land.

               An  item with unknown status will be reported in your inven-
          tory with no prefix.  An item which you know the state of will be
          distinguished  in  your  inventory  by  the  presence of the word
          cursed, uncursed, or blessed in the description of the item.   In
          some  cases  uncursed  will  be  omitted  as being redundant when
          enough other information is displayed.  The implicit_uncursed op-
          tion  can be used to control this; toggle it off to have uncursed
          be displayed even when that can be deduced from other attributes.

               Sometimes the bless or curse state of objects is referred to
          as their "BUC" attribute, for Blessed, Uncursed, or Cursed state,
          or "BUCX" for Blessed, Uncursed, Cursed, or unknown.   (The  term
          beatitude is occasionally used as well.)

          7.2.  Weapons (`)')

               Given  a  chance,  most monsters in the Mazes of Menace will
          gratuitously try to kill you.  You need weapons for  self-defense
          (killing  them  first).   Without  a  weapon, you do only 1-2 hit
          points of damage (plus bonuses, if any).  Monk characters are  an
          exception;  they  normally  do  more damage with bare (or gloved)
          hands than they do with weapons.

               There are wielded weapons, like maces and swords, and thrown
          weapons,  like arrows and spears.  To hit monsters with a weapon,
          you must wield it and attack them, or throw it at them.  You  can
          simply  elect  to  throw  a spear.  To shoot an arrow, you should
          first wield a bow, then throw the arrow.  Crossbows shoot  cross-
          bow bolts.  Slings hurl rocks and (other) stones (like gems).

               Enchanted  weapons  have  a  "plus" (or "to hit enhancement"
          which can be either positive  or  negative)  that  adds  to  your
          chance  to  hit and the damage you do to a monster.  The only way
          to determine a weapon's enchantment is to have it magically iden-
          tified  somehow.  Most weapons are subject to some type of damage
          like rust.  Such "erosion" damage can be repaired.

               The chance that an attack will successfully hit  a  monster,
          and  the  amount  of damage such a hit will do, depends upon many
          factors.  Among them are: type of weapon, quality of weapon  (en-
          chantment and/or erosion), experience level, strength, dexterity,
          encumbrance, and proficiency (see below).   The  monster's  armor
          class--a  general  defense rating, not necessarily due to wearing
          of armor--is a factor too; also, some monsters  are  particularly
          vulnerable to certain types of weapons.

               Many  weapons  can be wielded in one hand; some require both
          hands.  When wielding a two-handed weapon, you  can  not  wear  a
          shield,  and  vice versa.  When wielding a one-handed weapon, you
          can have another weapon ready to use by setting  things  up  with


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              44



          the  `x'  command,  which  exchanges  your primary (the one being
          wielded) and alternate weapons.  And if you have  proficiency  in
          the  "two weapon combat" skill, you may wield both weapons simul-
          taneously as primary and secondary; use the `X' command to engage
          or  disengage  that.   Only some types of characters (barbarians,
          for instance) have the necessary skill available.  Even with that
          skill,  using  two weapons at once incurs a penalty in the chance
          to hit your target compared to using just one weapon at a time.

               There might be times when you'd rather not wield any  weapon
          at  all.  To accomplish that, wield `-', or else use the `A' com-
          mand which allows you to unwield the current weapon  in  addition
          to taking off other worn items.

               Those  of you in the audience who are AD&D players, be aware
          that each weapon which existed in AD&D does roughly the same dam-
          age  to  monsters  in  NetHack.  Some of the more obscure weapons
          (such as the aklys, lucern hammer, and bec-de-corbin) are defined
          in an appendix to Unearthed Arcana, an AD&D supplement.

               The  commands  to  use weapons are `w' (wield), `t' (throw),
          `f' (fire), `Q' (quiver), `x' (exchange),  `X'  (twoweapon),  and
          "#enhance" (see below).

          7.2.1.  Throwing and shooting

               You  can  throw just about anything via the `t' command.  It
          will prompt for the item to throw; picking `?' will  list  things
          in  your  inventory  which are considered likely to be thrown, or
          picking `*' will list your entire inventory.  After you've chosen
          what  to  throw, you will be prompted for a direction rather than
          for a specific target.  The distance something can be thrown  de-
          pends mainly on the type of object and your strength.  Arrows can
          be thrown by hand, but can be thrown much  farther  and  will  be
          more likely to hit when thrown while you are wielding a bow.

               Some weapons will return when thrown.  A boomerang--provided
          it fails to hit anything--is an obvious  example.   If  an  aklys
          (thonged club) is thrown while it is wielded, it will return even
          when it hits something.  A sufficiently strong hero can throw the
          warhammer Mjollnir; when thrown by a Valkyrie it will return too.
          However, aklyses and Mjollnir occasionally fail to  return.   Re-
          turning  thrown objects occasionally fail to be caught, sometimes
          even hitting the thrower, but when caught they become re-wielded.

               You can simplify the throwing operation  by  using  the  `Q'
          command  to  select  your preferred "missile", then using the `f'
          command to throw it.  You'll  be  prompted  for  a  direction  as
          above,  but  you  don't  have to specify which item to throw each
          time you use `f'.  There is also an option, autoquiver, which has
          NetHack choose another item to automatically fill your quiver (or
          quiver sack, or have at the ready) when the inventory  slot  used
          for  `Q' runs out.  If your quiver is empty, autoquiver is false,
          and you are wielding a weapon which returns when thrown, you will


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              45



          throw  that  weapon instead of filling the quiver.  The fire com-
          mand also has extra assistance, if fireassist is on it  will  try
          to wield a launcher matching the ammo in the quiver.

               Some  characters have the ability to throw or shoot a volley
          of multiple items (from the  same  stack)  in  a  single  action.
          Knowing how to load several rounds of ammunition at once--or hold
          several missiles in your hand--and still hit a target is  not  an
          easy  task.   Rangers are among those who are adept at this task,
          as are those with a high level of  proficiency  in  the  relevant
          weapon  skill  (in  bow skill if you're wielding one to shoot ar-
          rows, in crossbow skill if you're wielding one to shoot bolts, or
          in sling skill if you're wielding one to shoot stones).  The num-
          ber of items that the character has a chance to fire varies  from
          turn  to  turn.   You can explicitly limit the number of shots by
          using a numeric prefix before the `t' or `f' command.  For  exam-
          ple,  "2f"  (or "n2f" if using number_pad mode) would ensure that
          at most 2 arrows are shot even if you could have fired 3.  If you
          specify  a  larger number than would have been shot ("4f" in this
          example), you'll just end up shooting the same number  (3,  here)
          as if no limit had been specified.  Once the volley is in motion,
          all of the items will travel in the same direction; if the  first
          ones  kill  a  monster, the others can still continue beyond that
          spot.

          7.2.2.  Weapon proficiency

               You will have varying degrees of skill in the weapons avail-
          able.   Weapon proficiency, or weapon skills, affect how well you
          can use particular types of weapons, and you'll be  able  to  im-
          prove  your  skills  as you progress through a game, depending on
          your role, your experience level, and use of the weapons.

               For the purposes of proficiency, weapons have  been  divided
          up   into  various  groups  such  as  daggers,  broadswords,  and
          polearms.  Each role has a limit on what level of  proficiency  a
          character  can achieve for each group.  For instance, wizards can
          become highly skilled in daggers or staves but not in  swords  or
          bows.

               The  "#enhance"  extended  command is used to review current
          weapons proficiency (also spell proficiency) and to choose  which
          skill(s) to improve when you've used one or more skills enough to
          become eligible to do so.  The skill rankings are  "none"  (some-
          times also referred to as "restricted", because you won't be able
          to advance), "unskilled", "basic", "skilled", and "expert".   Re-
          stricted skills simply will not appear in the list shown by "#en-
          hance".   (Divine  intervention  might  unrestrict  a  particular
          skill, in which case it will start at unskilled and be limited to
          basic.)  Some characters can enhance their barehanded  combat  or
          martial arts skill beyond expert to "master" or "grand master".

               Use of a weapon in which you're restricted or unskilled will
          incur a modest penalty in the chance to hit a monster and also in


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              46



          the  amount of damage done when you do hit; at basic level, there
          is no penalty or bonus; at skilled level, you  receive  a  modest
          bonus  in  the chance to hit and amount of damage done; at expert
          level, the bonus is higher.  A successful hit  has  a  chance  to
          boost  your  training towards the next skill level (unless you've
          already reached the limit for this skill).   Once  such  training
          reaches  the  threshold  for that next level, you'll be told that
          you feel more confident in your skills.  At that  point  you  can
          use  "#enhance"  to increase one or more skills.  Such skills are
          not increased automatically because there is a limit to your  to-
          tal  overall  skills, so you need to actively choose which skills
          to enhance and which to ignore.

          7.2.3.  Two-Weapon combat

               Some characters can use two weapons at once.  Setting things
          up  to  do  so can seem cumbersome but becomes second nature with
          use.  To wield two weapons, you need to use the "#twoweapon" com-
          mand.   But  first you need to have a weapon in each hand.  (Note
          that your two weapons are not fully equal; the one  in  the  hand
          you  normally  wield with is considered primary and the other one
          is considered secondary.  The most noticeable difference is after
          you  stop--or  before  you  begin,  for that matter--wielding two
          weapons at once.  The primary is your wielded weapon and the sec-
          ondary  is  just an item in your inventory that's been designated
          as alternate weapon.)

               If your primary weapon is wielded but your off hand is empty
          or  has the wrong weapon, use the sequence `x', `w', `x' to first
          swap your primary into your off hand, wield whatever you want  as
          secondary  weapon,  then  swap  them  both back into the intended
          hands.  If your secondary or alternate weapon is correct but your
          primary one is not, simply use `w' to wield the primary.  Lastly,
          if neither hand holds the correct weapon, use `w',  `x',  `w'  to
          first wield the intended secondary, swap it to off hand, and then
          wield the primary.

               The whole process can be simplified via  use  of  the  push-
          weapon option.  When it is enabled, then using `w' to wield some-
          thing causes the currently wielded weapon to become  your  alter-
          nate weapon.  So the sequence `w', `w' can be used to first wield
          the weapon you intend to be secondary, and then wield the one you
          want  as  primary  which will push the first into secondary posi-
          tion.

               When in two-weapon combat mode, using the `X'  command  tog-
          gles  back to single-weapon mode.  Throwing or dropping either of
          the weapons or having one of them be  stolen  or  destroyed  will
          also make you revert to single-weapon combat.

          7.3.  Armor (`[')

               Lots of unfriendly things lurk about; you need armor to pro-
          tect yourself from their blows.  Some types of armor offer better


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023

          protection  than  others.   Your armor class is a measure of this
          protection.  Armor class (AC) is measured as in AD&D, with 10 be-
          ing  the equivalent of no armor, and lower numbers meaning better
          armor.  Each suit of armor which exists in AD&D  gives  the  same
          protection in NetHack.

               Here  is  a list of the armor class values provided by suits
          of armor:
                     Dragon scale mail                         1
                     Plate mail, Crystal plate mail            3
                     Bronze plate mail, Splint mail,
                        Banded mail, Dwarvish mithril-coat     4
                     Chain mail, Elven mithril-coat            5
                     Scale mail, Orcish chain mail             6
                     Ring mail, Studded leather armor,
                        Dragon scales                          7
                     Leather armor, Orcish ring mail           8
                     Leather jacket                            9
                     none                                     10

               You can also wear other pieces of armor  (cloak  over  suit,
          shirt  under  suit,  helmet, gloves, boots, shield) to lower your
          armor class even further.  Most of these provide  a  one  or  two
          point  improvement  to  AC  (making the overall value smaller and
          eventually negative) but can also be enchanted.   Shirts  are  an
          exception;  they  don't  provide any protection unless enchanted.
          Some cloaks also don't improve AC when unenchanted but all cloaks
          offer some protection against rust or corrosion to suits worn un-
          der them and against some monster touch attacks.

               If a piece of armor is enchanted, its armor protection  will
          be  better (or worse) than normal, and its "plus" (or minus) will
          subtract from your armor class.  For example,  a  +1  chain  mail
          would give you better protection than normal chain mail, lowering
          your armor class one unit further to 4.  When you put on a  piece
          of  armor,  you  immediately  find  out  the  armor class and any
          "plusses" it provides.  Cursed pieces of armor usually have nega-
          tive enchantments (minuses) in addition to being unremovable.

               Many  types of armor are subject to some kind of damage like
          rust.  Such damage can be repaired.  Some types of armor may  in-
          hibit spell casting.

               The  nudist  option  can be set (prior to game start) to at-
          tempt to play the entire game without wearing any armor (a  self-
          imposed challenge which is extremely difficult to accomplish).

               The commands to use armor are `W' (wear) and `T' (take off).
          The `A' command can be used to take off armor as  well  as  other
          worn  items.   Also, `P' (put on) and `R' (remove) which are nor-
          mally for accessories can be used for armor, but pieces of  armor
          won't be shown as likely candidates in a prompt for choosing what
          to put on or remove.



          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023

          7.4.  Food (`%')

               Food is necessary to survive.  If you go  too  long  without
          eating  you  will  faint, and eventually die of starvation.  Some
          types of food will spoil, and become unhealthy  to  eat,  if  not
          protected.   Food  stored in ice boxes or tins ("cans") will usu-
          ally stay fresh, but ice boxes are heavy, and tins take  a  while
          to open.

               When you kill monsters, they usually leave corpses which are
          also "food."  Many, but not all, of these are edible;  some  also
          give  you special powers when you eat them.  A good rule of thumb
          is "you are what you eat."

               Some character roles and some monsters are vegetarian.  Veg-
          etarian  monsters  will typically never eat animal corpses, while
          vegetarian players can, but with some rather unpleasant  side-ef-
          fects.

               You  can  name one food item after something you like to eat
          with the fruit option.

               The command to eat food is `e'.

          7.5.  Scrolls (`?')

               Scrolls are labeled with various titles, probably chosen  by
          ancient wizards for their amusement value (for example "READ ME,"
          or "THANX MAUD" backwards).  Scrolls  disappear  after  you  read
          them (except for blank ones, without magic spells on them).

               One  of  the most useful of these is the scroll of identify,
          which can be used to determine what another object is, whether it
          is  cursed  or  blessed, and how many uses it has left.  Some ob-
          jects of subtle enchantment are  difficult  to  identify  without
          these.

               A mail daemon may run up and deliver mail to you as a scroll
          of mail (on versions compiled with this feature).   To  use  this
          feature  on  versions where NetHack mail delivery is triggered by
          electronic mail appearing in your system mailbox,  you  must  let
          NetHack know where to look for new mail by setting the "MAIL" en-
          vironment variable to the file name of  your  mailbox.   You  may
          also  want  to  set  the "MAILREADER" environment variable to the
          file name of your favorite reader, so NetHack  can  shell  to  it
          when  you  read the scroll.  On versions of NetHack where mail is
          randomly generated internal to the game, these environment  vari-
          ables  are  ignored.   You can disable the mail daemon by turning
          off the mail option.

               The command to read a scroll is `r'.





          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              49



          7.6.  Potions (`!')

               Potions are distinguished by the color of the liquid  inside
          the flask.  They disappear after you quaff them.

               Clear  potions  are  potions  of water.  Sometimes these are
          blessed or cursed, resulting in holy or unholy water.  Holy water
          is  the  bane  of  the  undead, so potions of holy water are good
          things to throw (`t') at them.  It is also sometimes very  useful
          to dip ("#dip") an object into a potion.

               The command to drink a potion is `q' (quaff).

          7.7.  Wands (`/')

               Wands  usually have multiple magical charges.  Some types of
          wands require a direction in which to zap them.  You can also zap
          them  at yourself (just give a `.' or `s' for the direction).  Be
          warned, however, for this is often unwise.  Other types of  wands
          don't  require  a  direction.  The number of charges in a wand is
          random and decreases by one whenever you use it.

               When the number of charges left in a wand becomes zero,  at-
          tempts  to use the wand will usually result in nothing happening.
          Occasionally, however, it may be possible to squeeze the last few
          mana  points  from  an otherwise spent wand, destroying it in the
          process.  A wand may be recharged by using  suitable  magic,  but
          doing  so runs the risk of causing it to explode.  The chance for
          such an explosion starts out very small and increases  each  time
          the wand is recharged.

               In a truly desperate situation, when your back is up against
          the wall, you might decide to go for broke and break  your  wand.
          This  is  not  for the faint of heart.  Doing so will almost cer-
          tainly cause a catastrophic release of magical energies.

               When you have fully identified a particular wand,  inventory
          display  will  include additional information in parentheses: the
          number of times it has been recharged followed  by  a  colon  and
          then by its current number of charges.  A current charge count of
          -1 is a special case indicating that the wand has been cancelled.

               The command to use a wand is `z' (zap).  To break  one,  use
          the `a' (apply) command.

          7.8.  Rings (`=')

               Rings  are very useful items, since they are relatively per-
          manent magic, unlike the usually  fleeting  effects  of  potions,
          scrolls, and wands.

               Putting on a ring activates its magic.  You can wear at most
          two rings at any time, one on the ring finger of each hand.



          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              50



               Most worn rings also cause you to grow hungry more  rapidly,
          the rate varying with the type of ring.

               When  wearing  gloves,  rings  are  worn underneath.  If the
          gloves are cursed, rings cannot be put on and any  already  being
          worn  cannot  be  removed.   When  worn gloves aren't cursed, you
          don't have to manually take them off before putting on or  remov-
          ing  a  ring and then re-wear them after.  That's done implicitly
          to avoid unnecessary tedium.

               The commands to use rings are `P' (put on) and `R' (remove).
          `A', `W', and `T' can also be used; see Amulets.

          7.9.  Spellbooks (`+')

               Spellbooks are tomes of mighty magic.  When studied with the
          `r' (read) command, they transfer to the reader the knowledge  of
          a  spell (and therefore eventually become unreadable)--unless the
          attempt backfires.  Reading a cursed spellbook or one with mystic
          runes beyond your ken can be harmful to your health!

               A  spell (even when learned) can also backfire when you cast
          it.  If you attempt to cast a spell well  above  your  experience
          level,  or  if  you  have little skill with the appropriate spell
          type, or cast it at a time when your luck  is  particularly  bad,
          you  can  end up wasting both the energy and the time required in
          casting.

               Casting a spell calls forth  magical  energies  and  focuses
          them  with  your naked mind.  Some of the magical energy released
          comes from within you.  Casting temporarily drains  your  magical
          power, which will slowly be recovered, and causes you to need ad-
          ditional food.  Casting of spells also requires  practice.   With
          practice,  your  skill in each category of spell casting will im-
          prove.  Over time, however, your memory of each spell  will  dim,
          and you will need to relearn it.

               Some spells require a direction in which to cast them, simi-
          lar to wands.  To cast one at yourself, just give a  `.'  or  `s'
          for the direction.  A few spells require you to pick a target lo-
          cation rather than just specify a  particular  direction.   Other
          spells don't require any direction or target.

               Just as weapons are divided into groups in which a character
          can become proficient (to varying degrees), spells are  similarly
          grouped.  Successfully casting a spell exercises its skill group;
          using the "#enhance" command to advance a sufficiently  exercised
          skill  will  affect  all spells within the group.  Advanced skill
          may increase the potency of spells, reduce their risk of  failure
          during casting attempts, and improve the accuracy of the estimate
          for how much longer they will be retained in your memory.   Skill
          slots  are  shared with weapons skills.  (See also the section on
          "Weapon proficiency".)



          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              51



               Casting a spell also requires flexible movement, and wearing
          various types of armor may interfere with that.

               The  command to read a spellbook is the same as for scrolls,
          `r' (read).  The `+' command lists each spell you know along with
          its level, skill category, chance of failure when casting, and an
          estimate of how strongly it is remembered.  The `Z'  (cast)  com-
          mand casts a spell.

          7.10.  Tools (`(')

               Tools are miscellaneous objects with various purposes.  Some
          tools have a limited number of uses, akin to wand  charges.   For
          example,  lamps burn out after a while.  Other tools are contain-
          ers, which objects can be placed into or taken out of.

               Some tools (such as a blindfold) can be worn and can be  put
          on  and  removed  like  other  accessories  (rings, amulets); see
          Amulets.  Other tools (such as pick-axe) can be wielded as  weap-
          ons  in addition to being applied for their usual purpose, and in
          some cases (again, pick-axe) become wielded as a weapon even when
          applied.

               The blind option can be set (prior to game start) to attempt
          to play the entire game without being able to see (a self-imposed
          challenge which is very difficult to accomplish).

               The command to use a tool is `a' (apply).

          7.10.1.  Containers

               You  may  encounter bags, boxes, and chests in your travels.
          A tool of this sort can be opened with the "#loot" extended  com-
          mand  when  you  are  standing on top of it (that is, on the same
          floor spot), or with the `a' (apply) command when you are  carry-
          ing  it.   However,  chests are often locked, and are in any case
          unwieldy objects.  You must set one down before unlocking  it  by
          using a key or lock-picking tool with the `a' (apply) command, by
          kicking it with the `^D' command, or by using a weapon  to  force
          the lock with the "#force" extended command.

               Some chests are trapped, causing nasty things to happen when
          you unlock or open them.  You can check for and try to deactivate
          traps with the "#untrap" extended command.

          7.11.  Amulets (`"')

               Amulets  are very similar to rings, and often more powerful.
          Like rings, amulets have various magical properties, some benefi-
          cial, some harmful, which are activated by putting them on.

               Only  one  amulet  may  be worn at a time, around your neck.
          Like wearing rings, wearing an amulet  affects  your  metabolism,
          causing you to grow hungry more rapidly.


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              52



               The  commands  to use amulets are the same as for rings, `P'
          (put on) and `R' (remove).  `A' can be  used  to  remove  various
          worn  items  including  amulets.   Also, `W' (wear) and `T' (take
          off) which are normally for armor can be  used  for  amulets  and
          other  accessories  (rings and eyewear), but accessories won't be
          shown as likely candidates in a prompt for choosing what to  wear
          or take off.

          7.12.  Gems (`*')

               Some  gems  are valuable, and can be sold for a lot of gold.
          They are also a far more efficient way of carrying  your  riches.
          Valuable gems increase your score if you bring them with you when
          you exit.

               Other small rocks are also categorized as gems, but they are
          much  less  valuable.  All rocks, however, can be used as projec-
          tile weapons (if you have a sling).  In  the  most  desperate  of
          cases, you can still throw them by hand.

          7.13.  Large rocks (``')

               Statues  and  boulders  are not particularly useful, and are
          generally heavy.  It is rumored that some statues  are  not  what
          they seem.

               Boulders  occasionally  block  your  path.  You can push one
          forward (by attempting to walk onto its spot) when nothing blocks
          its  path,  or  you  can smash it into a pile of small rocks with
          breaking magic or a pick-axe.  It is  possible  to  move  onto  a
          boulder's  location if certain conditions are met; ordinarily one
          of those conditions is that pushing it any  further  be  blocked.
          Using  the move-without-picking-up prefix (default key `m') prior
          to the direction of movement will attempt to move to a  boulder's
          location without pushing it in addition to the prefix's usual ac-
          tion of suppressing auto-pickup at the destination.

               Very large humanoids (giants and their ilk) have been  known
          to pick up boulders and use them as missile weapons.

               Unlike  boulders, statues can't be pushed, but don't need to
          be because they don't block movement.  They can be  smashed  into
          rocks though.

               For  some  configurations  of  the  program,  statues are no
          longer shown as ``' but by the letter  representing  the  monster
          they depict instead.

          7.14.  Gold (`$')

               Gold  adds  to  your  score, and you can buy things in shops
          with it.  There are a number of monsters in the dungeon that  may
          be influenced by the amount of gold you are carrying (shopkeepers
          aside).


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              53



               Gold pieces are the only type of  object  where  bless/curse
          state  does  not  apply.   They're  always uncursed but never de-
          scribed as uncursed even if you turn  off  the  implicit_uncursed
          option.   You can set the goldX option if you prefer to have gold
          pieces be treated as bless/curse state  unknown  rather  than  as
          known  to  be uncursed.  Only matters when you're using an object
          selection prompt that can filter by "BUCX" state.

          7.15.  Persistence of Objects

               Normally, if you have seen an object at a particular map lo-
          cation  and move to another location where you can't directly see
          that object any more, it will continue to be  displayed  on  your
          map.   That remains the case even if it is not actually there any
          more--perhaps a monster has picked it up or it has rotted  away--
          until  you  can see or feel that location again.  One notable ex-
          ception is that if the object gets covered  by  the  "remembered,
          unseen  monster" marker.  When that marker is later removed after
          you've verified that no monster is there, you will have forgotten
          that  there was any object there regardless of whether the unseen
          monster actually took the object.  If the object is still  there,
          then  once  you  see or feel that location again you will re-dis-
          cover the object and resume remembering it.

               The situation is the same for a pile of objects, except that
          only  the top item of the pile is displayed.  The hilite_pile op-
          tion can be enabled in order to show an item differently when  it
          is the top one of a pile.

          8.  Conduct

               As  if  winning  NetHack  were not difficult enough, certain
          players seek to challenge themselves by imposing restrictions  on
          the  way  they play the game.  The game automatically tracks some
          of these challenges, which can be checked at any  time  with  the
          #conduct  command or at the end of the game.  When you perform an
          action which breaks a challenge, it will  no  longer  be  listed.
          This  gives  players extra "bragging rights" for winning the game
          with these challenges.  Note that it is perfectly  acceptable  to
          win  the game without resorting to these restrictions and that it
          is unusual for players to adhere to  challenges  the  first  time
          they win the game.

               Several  of  the  challenges are related to eating behavior.
          The most difficult of these is the foodless challenge.   Although
          creatures can survive long periods of time without food, there is
          a physiological need for water; thus there is no  restriction  on
          drinking  beverages,  even  if they provide some minor food bene-
          fits.  Calling upon your god for help with  starvation  does  not
          violate any food challenges either.

               A  strict  vegan  diet  is one which avoids any food derived
          from animals.  The primary source of nutrition is fruits and veg-
          etables.  The corpses and tins of blobs (`b'), jellies (`j'), and


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              54



          fungi (`F') are also considered to be vegetable matter.   Certain
          human  food  is  prepared without animal products; namely, lembas
          wafers, cram rations, food rations (gunyoki), K-rations,  and  C-
          rations.   Metal  or another normally indigestible material eaten
          while polymorphed into a creature that can digest it is also con-
          sidered  vegan  food.   Note however that eating such items still
          counts against foodless conduct.

               Vegetarians do not eat animals; however, they are  less  se-
          lective  about eating animal byproducts than vegans.  In addition
          to the vegan items listed above, they may eat any kind of pudding
          (`P') other than the black puddings, eggs and food made from eggs
          (fortune cookies and pancakes), food made with milk  (cream  pies
          and candy bars), and lumps of royal jelly.  Monks are expected to
          observe a vegetarian diet.

               Eating any kind of meat violates the vegetarian, vegan,  and
          foodless  conducts.   This includes tripe rations, the corpses or
          tins of any monsters not mentioned above, and the  various  other
          chunks  of meat found in the dungeon.  Swallowing and digesting a
          monster while polymorphed is treated as if you ate the creature's
          corpse.   Eating  leather, dragon hide, or bone items while poly-
          morphed into a creature that can digest  it,  or  eating  monster
          brains while polymorphed into a mind flayer, is considered eating
          an animal, although wax is only an animal byproduct.

               Regardless of conduct, there will be some  items  which  are
          indigestible,  and  others  which  are hazardous to eat.  Using a
          swallow-and-digest attack against a monster is equivalent to eat-
          ing  the  monster's corpse.  Please note that the term "vegan" is
          used here only in the context of diet.  You  are  still  free  to
          choose  not  to  use  or  wear  items  derived from animals (e.g.
          leather, dragon hide, bone, horns, coral), but the game will  not
          keep  track  of this for you.  Also note that "milky" potions may
          be a translucent white, but they do not contain milk, so they are
          compatible  with  a  vegan  diet.   Slime molds or player-defined
          "fruits", although they could  be  anything  from  "cherries"  to
          "pork chops", are also assumed to be vegan.

               An atheist is one who rejects religion.  This means that you
          cannot #pray, #offer sacrifices to  any  god,  #turn  undead,  or
          #chat  with  a  priest.  Particularly selective readers may argue
          that playing Monk or Priest characters should violate  this  con-
          duct;  that  is a choice left to the player.  Offering the Amulet
          of Yendor to your god is necessary to win the  game  and  is  not
          counted against this conduct.  You are also not penalized for be-
          ing spoken to by an angry god, priest(ess),  or  other  religious
          figure; a true atheist would hear the words but attach no special
          meaning to them.

               Most players fight with a wielded weapon (or  tool  intended
          to be wielded as a weapon).  Another challenge is to win the game
          without using such a wielded weapon.  You are still permitted  to
          throw,  fire,  and kick weapons; use a wand, spell, or other type


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              55



          of item; or fight with your hands and feet.

               In NetHack, a pacifist refuses to cause  the  death  of  any
          other  monster  (i.e. if you would get experience for the death).
          This is a particularly difficult challenge, although it is  still
          possible to gain experience by other means.

               An  illiterate  character  does not read or write.  This in-
          cludes reading a scroll, spellbook, fortune cookie message, or t-
          shirt; writing a scroll; or making an engraving of anything other
          than a single "X" (the traditional  signature  of  an  illiterate
          person).   Reading  an  engraving, or any item that is absolutely
          necessary to win the game, is not counted against  this  conduct.
          The  identity of scrolls and spellbooks (and knowledge of spells)
          in your starting inventory is assumed to  be  learned  from  your
          teachers prior to the start of the game and isn't counted.

               There is a side-branch to the main dungeon called "Sokoban,"
          briefly described in the earlier section about  Traps.   As  men-
          tioned there, the goal is to push boulders into pits and/or holes
          to plug those in order to both get the boulders out  of  the  way
          and be able to go past the traps.  There are some special "rules"
          that are active when in that branch of the dungeon.   Some  rules
          can't  be bypassed, such as being unable to push a boulder diago-
          nally.  Other rules can, such as not smashing boulders with magic
          or  tools, but doing so causes you to receive a luck penalty.  No
          message about that is given at the time, but it is tracked  as  a
          conduct.   The  #conduct  command and end of game disclosure will
          report whether you have abided by the special rules  of  Sokoban,
          and  if not, how many times you violated them, providing you with
          a way to discover which actions incur bad luck so that you can be
          better informed about whether or not to avoid repeating those ac-
          tions in the future.  (Note:  the Sokoban conduct  will  only  be
          displayed  if  you have entered the Sokoban branch of the dungeon
          during the current game.  Once that has happened, it becomes part
          of  disclosed conduct even if you haven't done anything interest-
          ing there.  Ending the game with "never broke the Sokoban  rules"
          conduct is most meaningful if you also manage to perform the "ob-
          tained the Sokoban prize" achievement (see Achievements below).)

               There are several other challenges tracked by the game.   It
          is possible to eliminate one or more species of monsters by geno-
          cide; playing without this feature  is  considered  a  challenge.
          When the game offers you an opportunity to genocide monsters, you
          may respond with the monster type "none" if you want to  decline.
          You  can change the form of an item into another item of the same
          type ("polypiling") or the form of your  own  body  into  another
          creature  ("polyself")  by  wand,  spell, or potion of polymorph;
          avoiding these effects are each considered challenges.   Polymor-
          phing  monsters,  including  pets, does not break either of these
          challenges.  Finally, you may sometimes receive  wishes;  a  game
          without  an attempt to wish for any items is a challenge, as is a
          game without wishing for an artifact (even if the artifact  imme-
          diately  disappears).  When the game offers you an opportunity to


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              56



          make a wish for an item, you may choose "nothing" if you want  to
          decline.

          8.1.  Achievements

               End  of  game  disclosure will also display various achieve-
          ments representing progress toward  ultimate  ascension,  if  any
          have  been attained.  They aren't directly related to conduct but
          are grouped with it because they fall into the same  category  of
          "bragging  rights"  and  to  limit the number of questions during
          disclosure.  Listed here roughly in order of difficulty  and  not
          necessarily in the order in which you might accomplish them.

          Notes:

               Achievements are recorded and subsequently reported  in  the
          order  in  which they happen during your current game rather than
          the order listed here.

               There are nine <Rank> titles for each role, bestowed at  ex-
          perience levels 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, and 30.  The one for
          experience level 1 is not recorded  as  an  achievement.   Losing
          enough  levels  to  revert  to lower rank(s) does not discard the
          corresponding achievement(s).




          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              57



               There's no guaranteed Novel so the achievement to  read  one
          might not always be attainable (except perhaps by wishing).  Sim-
          ilarly, the Big Room level is not always  present.   Unlike  with
          the Novel, there's no way to wish for this opportunity.

               The "special items" hidden in Mines' End and Sokoban are not
          unique but are considered to be prizes or rewards  for  exploring
          those  levels  since  doing  so  is not necessary to complete the
          game.  Finding other instances of the same objects doesn't record
          the corresponding achievement.

               The  Medusa achievement is recorded if she dies for any rea-
          son, even if you are not directly responsible, and  only  if  she
          dies.

               The  5-note  tune  can be learned via trial and error with a
          musical instrument played closely enough--but not too  close!--to
          the  Castle  level's drawbridge or can be given to you via prayer
          boon.

               Blind and Nudist are also conducts, and they can only be en-
          abled  by  setting the correspondingly named option in NETHACKOP-
          TIONS or run-time configuration file prior to game start.  In the
          case of Blind, the option also enforces the conduct.  They aren't
          really significant accomplishments unless/until you make substan-
          tial progress into the dungeon.

          9.  Options

               Due  to variations in personal tastes and conceptions of how
          NetHack should do things, there are options you can set to change
          how NetHack behaves.

          9.1.  Setting the options

               Options  may  be  set in a number of ways.  Within the game,
          the `O' command allows you to view all options and change most of
          them.   You can also set options automatically by placing them in
          a configuration file, or in the NETHACKOPTIONS environment  vari-
          able.  Some versions of NetHack also have front-end programs that
          allow you to set options before starting the  game  or  a  global
          configuration for system administrators.

          9.2.  Using a configuration file

               The default name of the configuration file varies on differ-
          ent operating systems.

               On UNIX, Linux, and macOS it is ".nethackrc" in  the  user's
          home directory.  The file may not exist, but it is a normal ASCII
          text file and can be created with any text editor.

               On Windows, the name is ".nethackrc" located in  the  folder
          "%USERPROFILE%\NetHack\".   The  file  may not exist, but it is a


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              58



          normal ASCII text file can can be created with any  text  editor.
          After  running  NetHack for the first time, you should find a de-
          fault template for the configuration file named  ".nethackrc.tem-
          plate"  in "%USERPROFILE%\NetHack\".  If you have not created the
          configuration file, NetHack will create one for you using the de-
          fault template file.

               On  MS-DOS,  it  is  "defaults.nh"  in  the  same  folder as
          nethack.exe.

               Any line in the configuration  file  starting  with  `#'  is
          treated as a comment and ignored.  Empty lines are ignored.

               Any  line  beginning with `[' and ending in `]' is a section
          marker (the closing `]' can be followed by whitespace and then an
          arbitrary  comment  beginning  with  `#').   The text between the
          square brackets is the section name.  Section  markers  are  only
          valid  after a CHOOSE directive and their names are case insensi-
          tive.  Lines after a section marker belong to that section up un-
          til  another section starts or a marker without a name is encoun-
          tered or the file ends.  Lines within sections are ignored unless
          a CHOOSE directive has selected that section.

               You  can use different configuration directives in the file,
          some of which can be used multiple times.  In general, the direc-
          tives are written in capital letters, followed by an equals sign,
          followed by settings particular to that directive.

               Here is a list of allowed directives:

          OPTIONS
            There are two types of options, boolean and  compound  options.
            Boolean  options toggle a setting on or off, while compound op-
            tions take more diverse values.  Prefix a boolean  option  with
            "no"  or  `!' to turn it off.  For compound options, the option
            name and value are separated by a colon.  Some options are per-
            sistent, and apply only to new games.  You can specify multiple
            OPTIONS directives, and multiple options separated by commas in
            a  single OPTIONS directive.  (Comma separated options are pro-
            cessed from right to left.)

            Example:

                 OPTIONS=dogname:Fido
                 OPTIONS=!legacy,autopickup,pickup_types:$"=/!?+

          HACKDIR
            Default location of files NetHack  needs.  On  Windows  HACKDIR
            defaults  to  the  location  of the NetHack.exe or NetHackw.exe
            file so setting HACKDIR to override that is not usually  neces-
            sary or recommended.

          LEVELDIR
            The  location that in-progress level files are stored. Defaults


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023

            to HACKDIR, must be writable.

          SAVEDIR
            The location where saved games are kept. Defaults  to  HACKDIR,
            must be writable.

          BONESDIR
            The  location  that  bones files are kept. Defaults to HACKDIR,
            must be writable.

          LOCKDIR
            The  location  that  file  synchronization  locks  are  stored.
            Defaults to HACKDIR, must be writable.

          TROUBLEDIR
            The  location  that  a record of game aborts and self-diagnosed
            game problems is kept. Defaults to HACKDIR, must be writable.

          AUTOCOMPLETE
            Enable or disable an extended command autocompletion.  Autocom-
            pletion  has no effect for the X11 windowport.  You can specify
            multiple autocompletions.  To enable autocompletion,  list  the
            extended  command.   Prefix the command with "!" to disable the
            autocompletion for that command.

            Example:

          AUTOPICKUP_EXCEPTION

          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              61





          Here is an example of configuration file contents:

          # Set your character's role, race, gender, and alignment.
          OPTIONS=role:Valkyrie, race:Human, gender:female, align:lawful
          #
          # Turn on autopickup, set automatically picked up object types
          OPTIONS=autopickup,pickup_types:$"=/!?+
          #
          # Map customization
          OPTIONS=color           # Display things in color if possible
          OPTIONS=lit_corridor    # Show lit corridors differently
          OPTIONS=hilite_pet,hilite_pile
          # Replace small punctuation (tick marks) with digits
          SYMBOLS=S_boulder:0,S_golem:7
          #
          # No startup splash screen. Windows GUI only.
          OPTIONS=!splash_screen



          9.3.  Using the NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable

               The  NETHACKOPTIONS  variable  is  a comma-separated list of
          initial values for the various options.  Some can only be  turned
          on  or  off.   You turn one of these on by adding the name of the
          option to the list, and turn it off by typing a `!' or  "no"  be-
          fore  the  name.  Others take a character string as a value.  You
          can set string options by typing the  option  name,  a  colon  or
          equals sign, and then the value of the string.  The value is ter-
          minated by the next comma or the end of string.

               For example, to set up an environment variable so that color
          is on, legacy is off, character name is set to "Blue Meanie", and
          named fruit is set to "lime", you would enter the command

          % setenv NETHACKOPTIONS "color,\!leg,name:Blue Meanie,fruit:lime"

          in csh (note the need to escape the `!'  since  it's  special  to
          that shell), or the pair of commands

          $ NETHACKOPTIONS="color,!leg,name:Blue Meanie,fruit:lime"
          $ export NETHACKOPTIONS

          in sh, ksh, or bash.

               The NETHACKOPTIONS value is effectively the same as a single
          OPTIONS directive in a configuration file.  The "OPTIONS=" prefix
          is  implied  and comma separated options are processed from right
          to left.  Other types of configuration directives such as BIND or
          MSGTYPE are not allowed.




          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              62



               Instead of a comma-separated list of options, NETHACKOPTIONS
          can be set to the full name of a configuration file you  want  to
          use.   If  that  full name doesn't start with a slash, precede it
          with `@' (at-sign) to let NetHack know that the rest is  intended
          as  a  file  name.  If it does start with `/', the at-sign is op-
          tional.

          9.4.  Customization options

               Here are explanations of what the various options do.  Char-
          acter  strings  that  are too long may be truncated.  Some of the
          options listed may be inactive in your dungeon.

               Some options are persistent,  and  are  saved  and  reloaded
          along with the game.  Changing a persistent option in the config-
          uration file applies only to new games.

          acoustics
            Enable messages about what your character hears  (default  on).
            Note that this has nothing to do with your computer's audio ca-
            pabilities.  Persistent.

          alignment
            Your  starting  alignment  (align:lawful,   align:neutral,   or
            align:chaotic).   You  may specify just the first letter.  Many
            roles and the non-human races restrict which alignments are al-
            lowed.   See  role  for a description of how to use negation to
            exclude choices.

            Default is random.  Cannot be set with the `O'  command.   Per-
            sistent.

          autodescribe
            Automatically  describe  the terrain under cursor when asked to
            get a location on the map (default true).  The whatis_coord op-
            tion controls whether the description includes map coordinates.

          autodig
            Automatically dig if you are wielding a digging tool and moving
            into a place that can be dug (default false).  Persistent.

          autoopen
            Walking into a closed door attempts to open it (default  true).
            Persistent.

          autopickup
            Automatically pick up things onto which you move (default off).
            Persistent.

            See pickup_types and also autopickup_exception for ways to  re-
            fine the behavior.

            Note:  prior  to  version 3.7.0, the default for autopickup was
            on.


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              63



          autoquiver
            This option controls what happens  when  you  attempt  the  `f'
            (fire)  command  when  nothing  is quivered or readied (default
            false).  When true, the  computer  will  fill  your  quiver  or
            quiver  sack  or make ready some suitable weapon.  Note that it
            will not take into account the blessed/cursed status,  enchant-
            ment,  damage,  or quality of the weapon; you are free to manu-
            ally fill your quiver or quiver sack or make ready with the `Q'
            command instead.  If no weapon is found or the option is false,
            the `t' (throw) command is executed instead.  Persistent.

          autounlock
            Controls what action to take when attempting  to  walk  into  a
            locked  door  or to loot a locked container.  Takes a plus-sign
            separated list of values:

            Untrap    - prompt about whether to attempt to find a trap;  it
                        might  fail  to  find  one even when present; if it
                        does find one, it will ask whether you want to  try
                        to  disarm the trap; if you decline, your character
                        will forget that the door or box is trapped;
            Apply-Key - if carrying a key or other unlocking  tool,  prompt
                        about using it;
            Kick      - kick the door (if you omit untrap or decline to at-
                        tempt untrap and you omit apply-key or you  lack  a
                        key or you decline to use the key; has no effect on
                        containers);
            Force     - try to force a container's lid with your  currently
                        wielded  weapon  (if  you omit untrap or decline to
                        attempt untrap and you omit apply-key or you lack a
                        key or you decline to use the key; has no effect on
                        doors);
            None      - none of the above; can't be combined with the other
                        choices.

            Omitting the value is treated as if autounlock:apply-key.  Pre-
            ceding autounlock with  `!'  or  "no"  is  treated  as  autoun-
            lock:none.

            Applying a key might set off a trap if the door or container is
            trapped.  Successfully kicking a door will break it and wake up
            nearby  monsters.   Successfully  forcing a container open will
            break its lock and might also destroy some of its  contents  or
            damage your weapon or both.

            The default is Apply-Key.  Persistent.

          blind
            Start the character permanently blind (default false).  Persis-
            tent.

          bones
            Allow saving and loading bones files (default  true).   Persis-
            tent.


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              64



          boulder
            Set  the  character  used  to  display boulders (default is the
            "large rock" class symbol, ``').

          catname
            Name your starting cat (for example "catname:Morris").   Cannot
            be set with the `O' command.

          character
            Synonym  for "role" to pick the type of your character (for ex-
            ample "character:Monk").  See role for more details.

          checkpoint
            Save game state after each level change, for possible  recovery
            after program crash (default on).  Persistent.

          cmdassist
            Have  the  game  provide some additional command assistance for
            new players if it detects some  anticipated  mistakes  (default
            on).

          confirm
            Have  user  confirm  attacks  on  pets,  shopkeepers, and other
            peaceable creatures (default on).  Persistent.

          dark_room
            Show out-of-sight areas of lit rooms (default on).  Persistent.

          disclose
            Controls what information the program  reveals  when  the  game
            ends.   Value  is  a space separated list of prompting/category
            pairs (default is "ni na nv ng nc no", prompt with default  re-
            sponse of `n' for each candidate).  Persistent.  The possibili-
            ties are:

                 i - disclose your inventory;
                 a - disclose your attributes;
                 v - summarize monsters that have been vanquished;
                 g - list monster species that have been genocided;
                 c - display your conduct; also achievements, if any;
                 o - display dungeon overview.

            Each disclosure possibility can optionally  be  preceded  by  a
            prefix  which  lets  you  refine  how it behaves.  Here are the
            valid prefixes:

                 y - prompt you and default to yes on the prompt;
                 n - prompt you and default to no on the prompt;
                 + - disclose it without prompting;
                 - - do not disclose it and do not prompt.

            The listing of vanquished monsters can be sorted, so there  are
            two additional choices for `v':



          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              65



                 ? - prompt you and default to ask on the prompt;
                 # - disclose it without prompting, ask for sort order.

            Asking refers to picking one of the orderings from a menu.  The
            `+' disclose without prompting choice, or  being  prompted  and
            answering `y' rather than `a', will default to showing monsters
            in the traditional order, from high level to low level.

            Omitted categories are implicitly added with `n' prefix.  Spec-
            ified categories with omitted prefix implicitly use `+' prefix.
            Order of the disclosure categories  does  not  matter,  program
            display for end-of-game disclosure follows a set sequence.

            (for  example "disclose:yi na +v -g o") The example sets inven-
            tory to prompt and default to yes, attributes to prompt and de-
            fault  to  no,  vanquished to disclose without prompting, geno-
            cided to not disclose and not  prompt,  conduct  to  implicitly
            prompt  and  default  to  no,  and overview to disclose without
            prompting.

            Note that the vanquished monsters list  includes  all  monsters
            killed by traps and each other as well as by you.  And the dun-
            geon overview shows all levels you had visited but does not re-
            veal things about them that you hadn't discovered.

          dogname
            Name your starting dog (for example "dogname:Fang").  Cannot be
            set with the `O' command.

          extmenu
            Changes the extended commands interface to  pop-up  a  menu  of
            available commands.  It is keystroke compatible with the tradi-
            tional interface except that it does not require that  you  hit
            Enter.  It is implemented for the tty interface (default off).

            For the X11 interface, which always uses a menu for choosing an
            extended command, it controls whether the menu shows all avail-
            able  commands  (on)  or just the subset of commands which have
            traditionally been considered extended ones (off).

          female
            An obsolete synonym for "gender:female".  Cannot  be  set  with
            the `O' command.

          fireassist
            This  option  controls  what  happens  when you attempt the `f'
            (fire) and don't have an appropriate launcher, such as a bow or
            a  sling,  wielded.   If  on,  you will automatically wield the
            launcher. Default is on.

          fixinv
            An object's inventory letter sticks to  it  when  it's  dropped
            (default  on).   If  this is off, dropping an object shifts all
            the remaining inventory letters.  Persistent.


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              66



          force_invmenu
            Commands asking for an inventory item show a menu instead of  a
            text query with possible menu letters. Default is off.

          fruit
            Name  a  fruit  after  something  you enjoy eating (for example
            "fruit:mango") (default "slime mold").  Basically  a  nostalgic
            whimsy  that  NetHack  uses  from time to time.  You should set
            this to something you find more  appetizing  than  slime  mold.
            Apples,  oranges,  pears,  bananas, and melons already exist in
            NetHack, so don't use those.

          gender
            Your starting gender (gender:male or gender:female).   You  may
            specify  just  the first letter.  Although you can still denote
            your gender using either of the deprecated male and female  op-
            tions, if the gender option is also present it will take prece-
            dence.  See role for a description of how to  use  negation  to
            exclude choices.

            Default  is  random.  Cannot be set with the `O' command.  Per-
            sistent.

          goldX
            When filtering  objects  based  on  bless/curse  state  (BUCX),
            whether  to  treat gold pieces as X (unknown bless/curse state,
            when "on") or U (known to be  uncursed,  when  "off",  the  de-
            fault).   Gold  is  never  blessed or cursed, but it is not de-
            scribed as "uncursed" even when the implicit_uncursed option is
            "off".

          help
            If  more  information is available for an object looked at with
            the `/' command, ask if you want to see it (default on).  Turn-
            ing  help  off  makes  just looking at things faster, since you
            aren't interrupted with the "More info?" prompt,  but  it  also
            means that you might miss some interesting and/or important in-
            formation.  Persistent.

          herecmd_menu
            When using a windowport that supports  mouse  and  clicking  on
            yourself  or  next  to you, show a menu of possible actions for
            the location.  Same as "#herecmdmenu" and "#therecmdmenu"  com-
            mands.

          hilite_pet
            Visually  distinguish  pets from similar animals (default off).
            The behavior of this option depends on the  type  of  windowing
            you use.  In text windowing, text highlighting or inverse video
            is often used; with tiles, generally displays  a  heart  symbol
            near pets.

            With  the  curses interface, the petattr option controls how to
            highlight pets and setting it will turn the  hilite_pet  option

            on or off as warranted.

          hilite_pile
            Visually  distinguish  piles of objects from individual objects
            (default off).  The behavior of this option depends on the type
            of  windowing you use.  In text windowing, text highlighting or
            inverse video is often used; with tiles, generally  displays  a
            small plus-symbol beside the object on the top of the pile.

          hitpointbar
            Show  a  hit  point bar graph behind your name and title.  Only
            available for TTY and Windows GUI, and only when  statushilites
            is on.

          horsename
            Name  your  starting  horse  (for example "horsename:Trigger").
            Cannot be set with the `O' command.

          ignintr
            Ignore interrupt signals, including breaks (default off).  Per-
            sistent.

          implicit_uncursed
            Omit "uncursed" from object descriptions when it can be deduced
            from other aspects of the description  (default  on).   Persis-
            tent.

            If you use menu coloring, you may want to turn this off.

          legacy
            Display an introductory message when starting the game (default
            on).  Persistent.

          lit_corridor
            Show corridor squares seen by night vision or  a  light  source
            held by your character as lit (default off).  Persistent.

          lootabc
            When  using  a  menu  to interact with a container, use the old
            `a', `b', and `c' keyboard shortcuts rather than the  mnemonics
            `o', `i', and `b' (default off).  Persistent.

          mail
            Enable mail delivery during the game (default on).  Persistent.

          male
            An  obsolete synonym for "gender:male".  Cannot be set with the
            `O' command.

          mention_decor
            Give feedback when walking onto various dungeon  features  such
            as  stairs,  fountains, or altars which are ordinarily only de-
            scribed when covered by one  or  more  objects  (default  off).
            Cannot be set with the `O' command.  Persistent.

          mention_walls
            Give  feedback when walking against a wall (default off).  Per-
            sistent.

          menucolors
            Enable coloring menu lines  (default  off).   See  "Configuring
            Menu Colors" on how to configure the colors.

          menustyle
            Controls the interface used when you need to choose various ob-
            jects (in response to the Drop  command,  for  instance).   The
            value  specified  should be the first letter of one of the fol-
            lowing: traditional, combination, full,  or  partial.   Persis-
            tent.

            Traditional  was  the  only  interface available for very early
            versions; it consists of a prompt for object class  characters,
            followed  by  an object-by-object prompt for all items matching
            the selected  object  class(es).   Combination  starts  with  a
            prompt  for  object  class(es) of interest, but then displays a
            menu of matching  objects  rather  than  prompting  one-by-one.
            Full  displays a menu of object classes rather than a character
            prompt, and then a menu  of  matching  objects  for  selection.
            Partial  skips  the object class filtering and immediately dis-
            plays a menu of all objects.

          menu_deselect_all
            Key to deselect all items in a menu.  Default `-'.

          menu_deselect_page
            Key to deselect all items on this page of a menu.  Default `\'.

          menu_first_page
            Key to jump to the first page in a menu.  Default `^'.

          menu_headings
            Controls how the headings in a menu  are  highlighted.   Values
            are  "none",  "bold", "dim", "italic", "underline", "blink", or
            "inverse".  Not all ports can actually display all types.

          menu_invert_all
            Key to invert all items in a menu.  Default `@'.

          menu_invert_page
            Key to invert all items on this page of a menu.  Default `~'.

          menu_last_page
            Key to jump to the last page in a menu.  Default `|'.

          menu_next_page
            Key to go to the next menu page.  Default `>'.

          menu_objsyms
            Show object symbols in menu headings in menus where the  object


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023

            symbols act as menu accelerators (default off).

          menu_overlay
            Do  not  clear the screen before drawing menus, and align menus
            to the right edge of the screen. Only for the tty  port.   (de-
            fault on)

          menu_previous_page
            Key to go to the previous menu page.  Default `<'.

          menu_search
            Key  to  search  for  some  text  and toggle selection state of
            matching menu items.  Default `:'.

          menu_select_all
            Key to select all items in a menu.  Default `.'.

          menu_select_page
            Key to select all items on this page of a menu.  Default `,'.

          menu_shift_left
            Key to scroll a menu--one which has been  scrolled  right--back
            to  the  left.   Implemented for perm_invent only by curses and
            X11.  Default `{'.

          menu_shift_right
            Key to scroll a menu which has text beyond the  right  edge  to
            the right.  Implemented for perm_invent only by curses and X11.
            Default `}'.

          monpolycontrol
            Prompt for new form whenever any monster changes shape (default
            off).  Debug mode only.

          mouse_support
            Allow  use  of  the mouse for input and travel.  Valid settings
            are:

                 0 - disabled
                 1 - enabled and make OS adjustments to support mouse use
                 2 - like 1 but does not make any OS adjustments

            Omitting a value is the  same  as  specifying  1  and  negating
            mouse_support is the same as specifying 0.

          msghistory
            The  number of top line messages to keep (and be able to recall
            with `^P') (default 20).  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

          msg_window
            Allows you to change the way recalled messages  are  displayed.
            Currently  it  is only supported for tty (all four choices) and
            for curses (`f' and `r' choices, default  `r').   The  possible
            values are:


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              70



                 s - single message (default; only choice prior to 3.4.0);
                 c - combination, two messages as "single", then as "full";
                 f - full window, oldest message first;
                 r - full window reversed, newest message first.

            For  backward  compatibility,  no  value  needs to be specified
            (which defaults  to  "full"),  or  it  can  be  negated  (which
            defaults to "single").

          name
            Set  your  character's  name (defaults to your user name).  You
            can also set your character's role by appending a dash and  one
            or more letters of the role (that is, by suffixing one of -A -B
            -C -H -K -M -P -Ra -Ro -S -T -V -W).  If -@  is  used  for  the
            role,  then  a random one will be automatically chosen.  Cannot
            be set with the `O' command.

          news
            Read the NetHack news file, if present (default on).  Since the
            news is shown at the beginning of the game, there's no point in
            setting this with the `O' command.

          nudist
            Start the character with no armor (default false).  Persistent.

          null
            Send padding nulls to the terminal (default on).  Persistent.

          number_pad
            Use digit keys instead of letters to move (default 0  or  off).
            Valid settings are:

             0 - move by letters; "yuhjklbn"
             1 - move by numbers; digit `5' acts as `G' movement prefix
             2 - like 1 but `5' works as `g' prefix instead of as `G'
             3 - by numbers using phone key layout; 123 above, 789 below
             4 - combines 3 with 2; phone layout plus MS-DOS compatibility
            -1 - by letters but use `z' to go northwest, `y' to zap wands

            For  backward  compatibility,  omitting  a value is the same as
            specifying 1 and negating number_pad is the same as  specifying
            0.   (Settings 2 and 4 are for compatibility with MS-DOS or old
            PC Hack; in addition to the different behavior for `5', `Alt-5'
            acts as `G' and `Alt-0' acts as `I'.  Setting -1 is to accommo-
            date some QWERTZ keyboards which have the location of  the  `y'
            and  `z'  keys  swapped.)   When  moving by numbers, to enter a
            count prefix for those commands which accept one (such as "12s"
            to  search  twelve  times),  precede  it  with  the  letter `n'
            ("n12s").

          packorder
            Specify  the  order  to   list   object   types   in   (default
            "")[%?+!=/(*`0_").  The value of this option should be a string
            containing the symbols  for  the  various  object  types.   Any


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023

            omitted types are filled in at the end from the previous order.

          paranoid_confirmation
            A  space  separated list of specific situations where alternate
            prompting  is  desired.   The  default  is  "paranoid_confirma-
            tion:pray swim".

            Confirm     - for  any  prompts  which are set to require "yes"
                          rather than `y', also require "no" to reject  in-
                          stead of accepting any non-yes response as no
            quit        - require "yes" rather than `y' to confirm quitting
                          the game or switching  into  non-scoring  explore
                          mode;
            die         - require  "yes"  rather  than `y' to confirm dying
                          (not useful in normal play;  applies  to  explore
                          mode);
            bones       - require  "yes"  rather than `y' to confirm saving
                          bones data when dying in debug mode;
            attack      - require "yes" rather than `y' to confirm  attack-
                          ing a peaceful monster;
            wand-break  - require "yes" rather than `y' to confirm breaking
                          a wand;
            eating      - require "yes" rather than `y' to confirm  whether
                          to continue eating;
            Were-change - require "yes" rather than `y' to confirm changing
                          form due to lycanthropy when hero  has  polymorph
                          control;
            pray        - require  `y' to confirm an attempt to pray rather
                          than immediately praying; on by default;
            Remove      - require selection from inventory for `R' and  `T'
                          commands  even  when  wearing just one applicable
                          item.
            swim        - prevent walking into water or lava.
            all         - turn on all of the above.

            By default, the pray choice is enabled,  the  others  disabled.
            To  disable  it  without  setting any of the other choices, use
            "paranoid_confirmation:none".  To keep it enabled while setting
            any  of  the  others,  include  it  in the list, such as "para-
            noid_confirmation:attack pray Remove".

          perm_invent
            If true, always display your current  inventory  in  a  window.
            This  only makes sense for windowing system interfaces that im-
            plement this feature.

          petattr
            Specifies one or more text highlighting attributes to use  when
            showing  pets  on  the  map.   Effectively  a  superset  of the
            hilite_pet boolean option.  Curses interface only; value is one
            or more of the following letters.





          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              72



                 n - Normal text (no highlighting)
                 i - Inverse video (default)
                 b - Bold text
                 u - Underlined text
                 k - blinKing text
                 d - Dim text
                 t - iTalic text
                 l - Left line indicator
                 r - Right line indicator

            Some  of  those  choices might not work, particularly the final
            three, depending upon terminal hardware or  terminal  emulation
            software.

            Currently  multiple  highlight-style letters can be combined by
            simply stringing them together (for example, "bk"), but in  the
            future  they  might require being separated by plus signs (such
            as "b+k", which works already).  When using the `n' choice,  it
            should  be specified on its own, not in combination with any of
            the other letters.

          pettype
            Specify the type of your initial pet,  if  you  are  playing  a
            character  class that uses multiple types of pets; or choose to
            have no initial pet at all.  Possible values are "cat",  "dog",
            "horse", and "none".  If the choice is not allowed for the role
            you are currently playing, it will be  silently  ignored.   For
            example,  "horse"  will  only be honored when playing a knight.
            Cannot be set with the `O' command.

          pickup_burden
            When you pick up an item that  would  exceed  this  encumbrance
            level  (Unencumbered,  Burdened, streSsed, straiNed, overTaxed,
            or overLoaded), you will be asked  if  you  want  to  continue.
            (Default `S').  Persistent.

          pickup_thrown
            If  this option is on and autopickup is also on, try to pick up
            things that you threw, even if they aren't in  pickup_types  or
            match an autopickup exception.  Default is on.  Persistent.

          pickup_types
            Specify the object types to be picked up when autopickup is on.
            Default is all types.  Persistent.

            The value is a list of object symbols, such as pickup_types:$?!
            to  pick  up  gold,  scrolls,  and  potions.   You  can use au-
            topickup_exception configuration file lines to  further  refine
            autopickup behavior.

            There  is no way to set pickup_types to "none".  (Setting it to
            an empty value reverts to "all".)  If you want to  avoid  auto-
            matically picking up any types of items but do want to have au-
            topickup on in  order  to  have  autopickup_exception  settings

            control what you do and don't pick up, you can set pickup_types
            to `.'.  That is the type symbol for venom and you  won't  come
            across any venom items so won't unintentionally pick such up.

          pile_limit
            When  walking  across a pile of objects on the floor, threshold
            at which the message "there are few/several/many objects  here"
            is  given  instead of showing a popup list of those objects.  A
            value of 0 means "no limit" (always list the objects); a  value
            of  1 effectively means "never show the objects" since the pile
            size will always be at least that  big;  default  value  is  5.
            Persistent.

          playmode
            Values  are  "normal", "explore", or "debug".  Allows selection
            of explore mode (also known as discovery mode)  or  debug  mode
            (also known as wizard mode) instead of normal play.  Debug mode
            might only be allowed for someone logged in under a  particular
            user  name  (on  multi-user systems) or specifying a particular
            character name (on single-user systems) or it might be disabled
            entirely.   Requesting  it when not allowed or not possible re-
            sults in explore mode instead.  Default is normal play.

          pushweapon
            Using the `w' (wield) command when already  wielding  something
            pushes  the  old  item into your alternate weapon slot (default
            off).  Likewise for the `a' (apply) command if  it  causes  the
            applied item to become wielded.  Persistent.

          quick_farsight
            When  set,  usually  prevents the "you sense your surroundings"
            message where play pauses to allow you to browse the map  when-
            ever clairvoyance randomly activates.  Some situations, such as
            being underwater or engulfed, ignore this option.  It does  not
            affect the clairvoyance spell where pausing to examine revealed
            objects or monsters is less intrusive.  Default is  off.   Per-
            sistent.

          race
            Selects  your  race (for example, race:human).  Choices are hu-
            man, dwarf, elf, gnome, and orc but most roles  restrict  which
            of the non-human races are allowed.  See role for a description
            of how to use negation to exclude choices.

            Default is random.  Cannot be set with the `O'  command.   Per-
            sistent.

          rest_on_space
            Make  the  space bar a synonym for the `.' (#wait) command (de-
            fault off).  Persistent.

          role
            Pick your type of character (for example,  role:Samurai);  syn-
            onym  for  character.   See  name  for  an  alternate method of

            specifying your role.

            This option can also be used to limit selection  when  role  is
            chosen  randomly.   Use a space-separated list of roles and ei-
            ther negate each one  or  negate  the  option  itself  instead.
            Negation is accomplished in the same manner as with boolean op-
            tions, by prefixing the option or  its  value(s)  with  `!'  or
            "no".
            Examples:

                 OPTIONS=role:!arc !bar !kni
                 OPTIONS=!role:arc bar kni

            There  can  be multiple instances of the role option if they're
            all negations.

            Default is random.  Cannot be set with the `O'  command.   Per-
            sistent.

          roguesymset
            This  option may be used to select one of the named symbol sets
            found within "symbols" to alter the symbols  displayed  on  the
            screen on the rogue level.

          rlecomp
            When writing out a save file, perform run length compression of
            the map.  Not all ports support run length compression. It  has
            no effect on reading an existing save file.

          runmode
            Controls  the amount of screen updating for the map window when
            engaged in multi-turn movement (running via shift+direction  or
            control+direction  and  so  forth, or via the travel command or
            mouse click).  The possible values are:

            teleport - update the map after movement has finished;
            run      - update the map after every seven or so steps;
            walk     - update the map after each step;
            crawl    - like walk, but pause briefly after each step.

            This option only affects the game's screen display, not the ac-
            tual  results  of moving.  The default is "run"; versions prior
            to 3.4.1 used "teleport" only.  Whether or not  the  effect  is
            noticeable will depend upon the window port used or on the type
            of terminal.  Persistent.

          safe_pet
            Prevent you from (knowingly) attacking your pets (default  on).
            Persistent.

          safe_wait
            Prevents  you  from waiting or searching when next to a hostile
            monster (default on). Persistent.

          sanity_check
            Evaluate monsters, objects, and map prior to each turn (default
            off).  Debug mode only.

          scores
            Control  what  parts of the score list you are shown at the end
            (for  example  "scores:5  top  scores/4  around  my   score/own
            scores").  Only the first letter of each category (`t', `a', or
            `o') is necessary.  Persistent.

          showexp
            Show your accumulated experience points on bottom line (default
            off).  Persistent.

          showrace
            Display  yourself  as  the glyph for your race, rather than the
            glyph for your role (default off).  Note that this setting  af-
            fects  only the appearance of the display, not the way the game
            treats you.  Persistent.

          showscore
            Show your approximate accumulated score on bottom line (default
            off).  Persistent.

          silent
            Suppress terminal beeps (default on).  Persistent.

          sortdiscoveries
            Controls the sorting behavior for the output of the `\' and ``'
            commands.  Persistent.

            The possible values are:

            o - list object types by class, in discovery order within  each
                class; default;
            s - list  object types by sortloot classification: by class, by
                sub-class within class for classes which  have  substantial
                groupings  (like  helmets,  boots, gloves, and so forth for
                armor), with object types  partly-discovered  via  assigned
                name coming before fully identified types;
            c - list by class, alphabetically within each class;
            a - list alphabetically across all classes.

            Can  be  interactively set via the `O' command or via using the
            `m' prefix before the `\' or ``' command.

          sortloot
            Controls the sorting behavior of the pickup lists for inventory
            and #loot commands and some others.  Persistent.

            The possible values are:

            full - always sort the lists;
            loot - only  sort  the  lists that don't use inventory letters,


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              76



                   like with the #loot and pickup commands;
            none - show lists the traditional way without sorting; default.

          sortpack
            Sort the pack contents by type when displaying  inventory  (de-
            fault on).  Persistent.

          sortvanquished
            Controls the sorting behavior for the output of the #vanquished
            command.  Persistent.

            The possible values are:

            t - traditional--order by monster level; ties are broken by in-
                ternal monster index; default;
            d - order by monster difficulty rating; ties broken by internal
                index;
            a - order alphabetically, first any unique  monsters  then  all
                the others;
            c - order  by  monster  class, by low to high level within each
                class;
            n - order by count, high to low; ties are  broken  by  internal
                monster index;
            z - order by count, low to high; ties broken by internal index.

            Can be interactively set via the `m O' command or via using the
            `m' prefix before the #vanquished command.

          sounds
            Allow sounds to be emitted from  an  integrated  sound  library
            (default on).

          sparkle
            Display a sparkly effect when a monster (including yourself) is
            hit by an attack to which it is resistant (default  on).   Per-
            sistent.

          standout
            Boldface monsters and "--More--" (default off).  Persistent.

          statushilites
            Controls  how  many turns status hilite behaviors highlight the
            field.  If negated or set to zero,  disables  status  hiliting.
            See "Configuring Status Hilites" for further information.

          status_updates
            Allow  updates  to the status lines at the bottom of the screen
            (default true).

          suppress_alert
            This option may be set to a NetHack version level  to  suppress
            alert  notification messages about feature changes for that and
            prior versions (for example "suppress_alert:3.3.1").



          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              77



          symset
            This option may be used to select one of the named symbol  sets
            found  within  "symbols"  to alter the symbols displayed on the
            screen.  Use "symset:default" to explicitly select the  default
            symbols.

          time
            Show  the  elapsed  game  time in turns on bottom line (default
            off).  Persistent.

          timed_delay
            When pausing momentarily for display effect, such as  with  ex-
            plosions  and  moving  objects, use a timer rather than sending
            extra characters to the screen.  (Applies to "tty" and "curses"
            interfaces  only; "X11" interface always uses a timer-based de-
            lay.  The default is on if configured into the program.)   Per-
            sistent.

          tips
            Show  some  helpful tips during gameplay (default on).  Persis-
            tent.

          tombstone
            Draw a tombstone graphic upon your death (default on).  Persis-
            tent.

          toptenwin
            Put the ending display in a NetHack window instead of on stdout
            (default off).  Setting this option makes the score list  visi-
            ble  when  a  windowing version of NetHack is started without a
            parent window, but it no longer leaves the  score  list  around
            after game end on a terminal or emulating window.

          travel
            Allow the travel command via mouse click (default on).  Turning
            this option off will prevent the  game  from  attempting  unin-
            tended  moves  if  you make inadvertent mouse clicks on the map
            window.  Does not affect traveling via the `_' ("#travel") com-
            mand.  Persistent.

          tutorial
            Play  a  tutorial level at the start of the game.  Setting this
            option on or off in the config file will skip the query.

          verbose
            Provide more commentary during the game (default on).   Persis-
            tent.

          whatis_coord
            When  using  the  `/' or `;' commands to look around on the map
            with autodescribe on, display coordinates  after  the  descrip-
            tion.   Also  works  in other situations where you are asked to
            pick a location.



          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              78



            The possible settings are:

                 c - compass ("east" or "3s" or "2n,4w");
                 f - full compass ("east" or "3south" or "2north,4west");
                 m - map <x,y> (map column x=0 is not used);
                 s - screen [row,column] (row is offset to match tty usage);
                 n - none (no coordinates shown) [default].

            The whatis_coord option is also used with the "/m", "/M", "/o",
            and "/O" sub-commands of `/', where the "none" setting is over-
            ridden with "map".

          whatis_filter
            When getting a location on the map, and using the keys to cycle
            through  next and previous targets, allows filtering the possi-
            ble targets.

                 n - no filtering [default]
                 v - in view only
                 a - in same area only

            The area-filter tries  to  be  slightly  predictive--if  you're
            standing on a doorway, it will consider the area on the side of
            the door you were last moving towards.

            Filtering can also be changed when getting a location with  the
            "getpos.filter" key.

          whatis_menu
            When  getting  a  location on the map, and using a key to cycle
            through next and previous targets, use a menu instead to pick a
            target.  (default off)

          whatis_moveskip
            When  getting a location on the map, and using shifted movement
            keys or meta-digit keys to fast-move, instead of moving 8 units
            at a time, move by skipping the same glyphs.  (default off)

          windowtype
            When the program has been built to support multiple interfaces,
            select which one to use, such as "tty" or  "X11"  (default  de-
            pends on build-time settings; use "#version" to check).  Cannot
            be set with the `O' command.

            When used, it should be the first option set  since  its  value
            might  enable  or disable the availability of various other op-
            tions.  For multiple lines in a configuration file, that  would
            be  the  first non-comment line.  For a comma-separated list in
            NETHACKOPTIONS or an OPTIONS line in a configuration file, that
            would be the rightmost option in the list.

          wizweight
            Augment object descriptions with their objects' weight (default
            off).  Debug mode only.

          zerocomp
            When writing out a save file, perform zero-comp compression  of
            the  contents.  Not all ports support zero-comp compression. It
            has no effect on reading an existing save file.

          9.5.  Window Port Customization options

               Here are explanations of the various options that  are  used
          to  customize  and  change  the characteristics of the windowtype
          that you have chosen.  Character strings that are too long may be
          truncated.   Not  all  window  ports will adjust for all settings
          listed here.  You can safely add any of  these  options  to  your
          configuration  file, and if the window port is capable of adjust-
          ing to suit your preferences, it will attempt to  do  so.  If  it
          can't  it will silently ignore it.  You can find out if an option
          is supported by the window port that you are currently  using  by
          checking to see if it shows up in the Options list.  Some options
          are dynamic and can be specified during the  game  with  the  `O'
          command.

          align_message
            Where  to align or place the message window (top, bottom, left,
            or right)

          align_status
            Where to align or place the status window (top,  bottom,  left,
            or right).

          ascii_map
            If  NetHack can, it should display the map using simple charac-
            ters (letters and punctuation) rather than tiles graphics.   In
            some  cases, characters can be augmented with line-drawing sym-
            bols; use the symset option to select  a  symbol  set  such  as
            DECgraphics or IBMgraphics if your display supports them.  Set-
            ting ascii_map to True forces tiled_map to be False.

          color
            If NetHack can, it should display color if it can for different
            monsters, objects, and dungeon features (default on).

          eight_bit_tty
            If  NetHack can, it should pass eight-bit character values (for
            example, specified with the traps option) straight  through  to
            your terminal (default off).

          font_map
            if NetHack can, it should use a font by the chosen name for the
            map window.

          font_menu
            If NetHack can, it should use a font by  the  chosen  name  for

          font_message
            If NetHack can, it should use a font by the chosen name for the
            message window.

          font_status
            If NetHack can, it should use a font by the chosen name for the
            status window.

          font_text
            If  NetHack  can,  it  should use a font by the chosen name for
            text windows.

          font_size_map
            If NetHack can, it should use this size font for the  map  win-
            dow.

          font_size_menu
            If NetHack can, it should use this size font for menu windows.

          font_size_message
            If  NetHack  can,  it should use this size font for the message
            window.

          font_size_status
            If NetHack can, it should use this size  font  for  the  status
            window.

          font_size_text
            If NetHack can, it should use this size font for text windows.

          fullscreen
            If  NetHack can, it should try and display on the entire screen
            rather than in a window.

          guicolor
            Use color text and/or highlighting attributes  when  displaying
            some  non-map data (such as menu selector letters).  Curses in-
            terface only; default is on.

          large_font
            If NetHack can, it should use a large font.

          map_mode
            If NetHack can, it should display the map in the manner  speci-
            fied.

          player_selection
            If  NetHack  can, it should pop up dialog boxes, or use prompts
            for character selection.

          popup_dialog
            If NetHack can, it should pop up dialog boxes for input.

          NetHack Guidebook                                              81



          preload_tiles
            If NetHack can, it should preload tiles into memory.  For exam-
            ple,  in  the  protected  mode  MS-DOS version, control whether
            tiles get pre-loaded into RAM at the start of the game.   Doing
            so  enhances  performance  of  the tile graphics, but uses more
            memory. (default on).  Cannot be set with the `O' command.

          scroll_amount
            If NetHack can, it should scroll the display by this number  of
            cells when the hero reaches the scroll_margin.

          scroll_margin
            If  NetHack  can, it should scroll the display when the hero or
            cursor is this number of cells away from the edge of  the  win-
            dow.

          selectsaved
            If  NetHack  can,  it  should  display a menu of existing saved
            games for the player to choose from at game startup, if it can.
            Not all ports support this option.

          softkeyboard
            Display  an  onscreen  keyboard.   Handhelds are most likely to
            support this option.

          splash_screen
            If NetHack can, it should display an opening splash screen when
            it starts up (default yes).

          statuslines
            Number  of  lines for traditional below-the-map status display.
            Acceptable values are 2 and 3 (default is 2).

            When set to 3, the tty interface moves some fields  around  and
            mainly  shows  status  conditions on their own line.  A display
            capable of showing at least 25 lines is recommended.  The value
            can be toggled back and forth during the game with the `O' com-
            mand.

            The curses interface does likewise if the  align_status  option
            is  set  to  top  or bottom but ignores statuslines when set to
            left or right.

            The Qt interface already displays more than 3 lines for  status
            so  uses  the statuslines value differently.  A value of 3 ren-
            ders status in the Qt interface's  original  format,  with  the
            status window spread out vertically.  A value of 2 makes status
            be slightly condensed, moving some fields to different lines to
            eliminate  one  whole  line,  reducing  the height needed.  (If
            NetHack has been built using a version of Qt older than qt-5.9,
            statuslines  can only be set in the run-time configuration file
            or via NETHACKOPTIONS, not during play with the `O' command.)

          NetHack Guidebook                                              82



          term_cols  and

          term_rows
            Curses interface only.  Number of columns and rows to  use  for
            the display.  Curses will attempt to resize to the values spec-
            ified but will settle for smaller sizes if they  are  too  big.
            Default is the current window size.

          tile_file
            Specify  the  name  of an alternative tile file to override the
            default.

            Note: the X11 interface uses X resources rather than  NetHack's
            options  to select an alternate tile file.  See NetHack.ad, the
            sample X "application defaults" file.

          tile_height
            Specify the preferred height of each tile  in  a  tile  capable
            port.

          tile_width
            Specify the preferred width of each tile in a tile capable port

          tiled_map
            If  NetHack can, it should display the map using tiles graphics
            rather than simple characters (letters and punctuation,  possi-
            bly  augmented  by line-drawing symbols).  Setting tiled_map to
            True forces ascii_map to be False.

          use_darkgray
            Use bold black instead of blue for black glyphs (TTY only).

          use_inverse
            If NetHack can, it should display inverse when the game  speci-
            fies it.

          vary_msgcount
            If  NetHack can, it should display this number of messages at a
            time in the message window.

          windowborders
            Whether to draw boxes around  the  map,  status  area,  message
            area,  and  persistent inventory window if enabled.  Curses in-
            terface only.  Acceptable values are

                 0 - off, never show borders
                 1 - on, always show borders
                 2 - auto, on if display is at least (24+2)x(80+2) [default]
                 3 - on, except forced off for perm_invent
                 4 - auto, except forced off for perm_invent

            (The 26x82 size threshold for `2' refers to number of rows  and
            columns  of  the  display.   A  width  of  at least 110 columns
            (80+2+26+2) is needed to show borders if align_status is set to


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              83



            left or right.)

            The  persistent  inventory window, when enabled, can grow until
            it is too big to fit on most displays, resulting in  truncation
            of  its  contents.  If borders are forced on (1) or the display
            is big enough to show them (2), setting the value to 3 or 4 in-
            stead  will  keep borders for the map, message, and status win-
            dows but have room for two additional lines of  inventory  plus
            widen each inventory line by two columns.

          windowcolors
            If  NetHack  can,  it should display windows with the specified
            foreground/background colors.  Windows GUI only.  The format is

               OPTION=windowcolors:wintype foreground/background

               where wintype is one  of  "menu",  "message",  "status",  or
          "text",  and foreground and background are colors, either a hexa-
          decimal \'#rrggbb', one of the named colors (black,  red,  green,
          brown,  blue, magenta, cyan, orange, brightgreen, yellow, bright-
          blue, brightmagenta, brightcyan, white, trueblack, gray,  purple,
          silver,  maroon,  fuchsia, lime, olive, navy, teal, aqua), or one
          of Windows UI colors (activeborder, activecaption,  appworkspace,
          background,  btnface,  btnshadow, btntext, captiontext, graytext,
          greytext, highlight, highlighttext, inactiveborder,  inactivecap-
          tion,  menu,  menutext,  scrollbar,  window, windowframe, window-
          text).

          wraptext
            If NetHack can, it should wrap long lines of text if they don't
            fit in the visible area of the window.

          9.6.  Platform-specific Customization options

               Here  are  explanations of options that are used by specific
          platforms or ports to customize and change the port behavior.

          altkeyhandling
            Select an alternate way to handle keystrokes (Win32 tty NetHack
            only).   The  name  of  the  handling type is one of "default",
            "ray", "340".

          altmeta
            On systems where this option is available, it  can  be  set  to
            tell NetHack to convert a two character sequence beginning with
            ESC into a meta-shifted version of the  second  character  (de-
            fault off).

            This  conversion is only done for commands, not for other input
            prompts.  Note that typing one or more digits as a count prefix
            prior  to  a command--preceded by n if the number_pad option is
            set--is also subject to this conversion, so attempting to abort
            the  count by typing ESC will leave NetHack waiting for another
            character to complete  the  two  character  sequence.   Type  a


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              84



            second ESC to finish cancelling such a count.  At other prompts
            a single ESC suffices.

          BIOS
            Use BIOS calls to update the screen display quickly and to read
            the  keyboard  (allowing  the use of arrow keys to move) on ma-
            chines with an IBM PC compatible BIOS ROM (default  off,  OS/2,
            PC, and ST NetHack only).

          rawio
            Force  raw (non-cbreak) mode for faster output and more bullet-
            proof input (MS-DOS sometimes treats `^P' as a  printer  toggle
            without  it)  (default  off,  OS/2,  PC,  and ST NetHack only).
            Note:  DEC Rainbows hang if this is turned on.  Cannot  be  set
            with the `O' command.

          subkeyvalue
            (Win32  tty  NetHack  only).  May be used to alter the value of
            keystrokes that the operating system returns to NetHack to help
            compensate  for international keyboard issues.  OPTIONS=subkey-
            value:171/92 will return 92 to NetHack, if 171  was  originally
            going to be returned.  You can use multiple subkeyvalue assign-
            ments in the configuration file if needed.  Cannot be set  with
            the `O' command.

          video
            Set the video mode used (PC NetHack only).  Values are "autode-
            tect", "default", "vga", or "vesa".  Setting "vesa" will  cause
            the game to display tiles, using the full capability of the VGA
            hardware.  Setting "vga" will cause the game to display  tiles,
            fixed  at  640x480 in 16 colors, a mode that is compatible with
            all VGA hardware. Third party tilesets will probably not  work.
            Setting  "autodetect"  attempts "vesa", then "vga", and finally
            sets "default" if neither of those modes works.  Cannot be  set
            with the `O' command.

          video_height
            Set   the   VGA  mode  resolution  height  (MS-DOS  only,  with
            video:vesa)

          video_width
            Set  the  VGA  mode  resolution  width   (MS-DOS   only,   with
            video:vesa)

          videocolors
            Set  the  color  palette for PC systems using NO_TERMS (default
            4-2-6-1-5-3-15-12-10-14-9-13-11, (PC NetHack only).  The  order
            of   colors   is   red,  green,  brown,  blue,  magenta,  cyan,
            bright.white, bright.red,  bright.green,  yellow,  bright.blue,
            bright.magenta,  and  bright.cyan.   Cannot be set with the `O'
            command.

          videoshades
            Set the intensity level of  the  three  gray  scales  available


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              85



            (default dark normal light, PC NetHack only).  If the game dis-
            play is difficult to read, try adjusting these scales; if  this
            does  not  correct the problem, try !color.  Cannot be set with
            the `O' command.

          9.7.  Regular Expressions

               Regular expressions are normally POSIX extended regular  ex-
          pressions.  It is possible to compile NetHack without regular ex-
          pression support on a platform where there is no regular  expres-
          sion  library.  While this is not true of any modern platform, if
          your NetHack was built this way, patterns are instead  glob  pat-
          terns. This applies to Autopickup exceptions, Message types, Menu
          colors, and User sounds.

          9.8.  Configuring Autopickup Exceptions

               You can further refine the behavior of the autopickup option
          beyond what is available through the pickup_types option.

               By  placing autopickup_exception lines in your configuration
          file, you can define patterns to be  checked  when  the  game  is
          about to autopickup something.

          autopickup_exception
            Sets   an  exception  to  the  pickup_types  option.   The  au-
            topickup_exception option should be followed by a  regular  ex-
            pression  to be used as a pattern to match against the singular
            form of the description of an object at your location.

            In addition, some characters are treated specially if they  oc-
            cur as the first character in the pattern, specifically:

                 < - always pickup an object that matches rest of pattern;
                 > - never pickup an object that matches rest of pattern.

            The  autopickup_exception  rules  are processed in the order in
            which they appear in your configuration file, thus  allowing  a
            later rule to override an earlier rule.

            Exceptions  can  be  set with the `O' command, but because they
            are not included in your configuration file, they won't  be  in
            effect  if you save and then restore your game.  autopickup_ex-
            ception rules and not saved with the game.

          Here are some examples:

                 autopickup_exception="<*arrow"
                 autopickup_exception=">*corpse"
                 autopickup_exception=">* cursed*"

               The first example above will result  in  autopickup  of  any
          type  of  arrow.   The second example results in the exclusion of
          any corpse from autopickup.  The  last  example  results  in  the


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              86



          exclusion of items known to be cursed from autopickup.

          9.9.  Changing Key Bindings

               It  is  possible  to change the default key bindings of some
          special commands, menu accelerator keys, and  extended  commands,
          by  using BIND stanzas in the configuration file.  Format is key,
          followed by the command to bind to, separated by  a  colon.   The
          key can be a single character ("x"), a control key ("^X", "C-x"),
          a meta key ("M-x"), a mouse  button,  or  a  three-digit  decimal
          ASCII code.

               For example:

               BIND=^X:getpos.autodescribe
               BIND=\:menu_first_page
               BIND=v:loot

          Extended command keys
            You  can  bind multiple keys to the same extended command.  Un-
            bind a key by using "nothing" as the extended command  to  bind
            to.   You  can  also bind the "<esc>", "<enter>", and "<space>"
            keys.

          Menu accelerator keys
            The menu control or accelerator keys can also  be  rebound  via
            OPTIONS  lines  in the configuration file.  You cannot bind ob-
            ject symbols or selection letters into menu accelerators.  Some
            interfaces only support some of the menu accelerators.

          Mouse buttons
            You can bind "mouse1" or "mouse2" to "nothing", "therecmdmenu",
            "clicklook", or "mouseaction".

          Special command keys
            Below are the special commands you can rebind.   Some  of  them
            can  be  bound to same keys with no problems, others are in the
            same "context", and if bound to same keys, only  one  of  those
            commands  will be available.  Special command can only be bound
            to a single key.

          count
            Prefix key to start a count, to  repeat  a  command  this  many
            times.  With number_pad only.  Default is `n'.

          getdir.help
            When  asked for a direction, the key to show the help.  Default
            is `?'.

          getdir.mouse

          9.10.  Configuring Message Types

               You can change the way the messages are shown in the message
          area, when the message matches a user-defined pattern.

               In  general,  the configuration file entries to describe the
          message types look like this: MSGTYPE=type "pattern"

          type    - how the message should be shown;
          pattern - the pattern to match.

            The pattern should be a regular expression.

            Allowed types are:

            show  - show message normally;
            hide  - never show the message;
            stop  - wait for user with more-prompt;
            norep - show the message once, but not again if no  other  mes-
                    sage is shown in between.

            Here's  an  example  of  message types using NetHack's internal
            pattern matching facility:

                 MSGTYPE=stop "You feel hungry."
                 MSGTYPE=hide "You displaced *."

            specifies that whenever a message "You feel hungry"  is  shown,
            the  user  is prompted with more-prompt, and a message matching
            "You displaced <something>." is not shown at all.

            The order of the defined MSGTYPE lines is important;  the  last
            matching  rule  is used. Put the general case first, exceptions
            below them.

          9.11.  Configuring Menu Colors

               Some platforms allow you to define colors used in menu lines
          when  the  line matches a user-defined pattern.  At this time the
          tty, curses, win32tty and win32gui interfaces support this.

               In general, the configuration file entries to  describe  the
          menu color mappings look like this:

               MENUCOLOR="pattern"=color&attribute

                 pattern    - the pattern to match;
                 color      - the  color to use for lines matching the pat-
                              tern;
                 attribute  - the attribute to use for lines  matching  the


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              90



                              pattern.  The  attribute  is optional, and if
                              left out, you must also leave out the preced-
                              ing  ampersand.   If no attribute is defined,
                              no attribute is used.

            The pattern should be a regular expression.

            Allowed colors are black, red,  green,  brown,  blue,  magenta,
            cyan,  gray, orange, light-green, yellow, light-blue, light-ma-
            genta, light-cyan, and white.  And no-color, the default  fore-
            ground  color,  which  isn't necessarily the same as any of the
            other colors.

            Allowed attributes are  none,  bold,  dim,  italic,  underline,
            blink,  and  inverse.   "Normal" is a synonym for "none".  Note
            that the platform used may interpret the attributes any way  it
            wants.

            Here's  an example of menu colors using NetHack's internal pat-
            tern matching facility:

                 MENUCOLOR="* blessed *"=green
                 MENUCOLOR="* cursed *"=red
                 MENUCOLOR="* cursed *(being worn)"=red&underline

            specifies that any menu line with " blessed " contained  in  it
            will  be  shown  in  green color, lines with " cursed " will be
            shown in red, and lines with  " cursed "  followed  by  "(being
            worn)"  on  the same line will be shown in red color and under-
            lined.  You can have multiple MENUCOLOR entries in your config-
            uration  file,  and the last MENUCOLOR line that matches a menu
            line will be used for the line.

               Note that if you intend to have one or more color specifica-
          tions  match " uncursed ", you will probably want to turn the im-
          plicit_uncursed option off so that all items known to be uncursed
          are actually displayed with the "uncursed" description.

          9.12.  Configuring User Sounds

               Some  platforms allow you to define sound files to be played
          when a message that matches a user-defined pattern  is  delivered
          to the message window.  At this time the Qt port and the win32tty
          and win32gui ports support the use of user sounds.

               The following configuration file  entries  are  relevant  to
          mapping user sounds to messages:

          SOUNDDIR
            The directory that houses the sound files to be played.

          SOUND
            An  entry  that  maps  a sound file to a user-specified message
            pattern.  Each SOUND entry is broken down  into  the  following


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              91



            parts:

            MESG        - message window mapping (the only one supported in
                          3.7.0);
            msgtype     - optional; message type to use,  see  "Configuring
                          Message Types"
            pattern     - the pattern to match;
            sound file  - the sound file to play;
            volume      - the  volume  to  be  set  while playing the sound
                          file;
            sound index - optional; the  index  corresponding  to  a  sound
                          file.

            The pattern should be a POSIX extended regular expression.

               For example:

               SOUNDDIR=C:\nethack\sounds
               SOUND=MESG "This door is locked" "lock.wav" 100
               SOUND=MESG hide "^You miss the " "swing.wav" 75

          9.13.  Configuring Status Hilites

               Your copy of NetHack may have been compiled with support for
          "Status Hilites".  If so, you can customize your game display  by
          setting thresholds to change the color or appearance of fields in
          the status display.

               The format for defining status colors is:

          OPTION=hilite_status:field-name/behavior/color&attributes

               For example, the following line in your  configuration  file
          will  cause  the  hitpoints  field to display in the color red if
          your hitpoints drop to or below a threshold of 30%:

          OPTION=hilite_status:hitpoints/<=30%/red/normal

          (That example is actually specifying red&normal for <=30% and no-
          color&normal for >30%.)

               For  another  example, the following line in your configura-
          tion file will cause wisdom to be displayed red if it  drops  and
          green if it rises:

          OPTION=hilite_status:wisdom/down/red/up/green

               Allowed  colors are black, red, green, brown, blue, magenta,
          cyan, gray, orange, light-green,  yellow,  light-blue,  light-ma-
          genta,  light-cyan, and white.  And "no-color", the default fore-
          ground color on the display, which is not necessarily the same as
          black or white or any of the other colors.




          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              92



               Allowed  attributes  are  none, bold, dim, underline, blink,
          and inverse.  "Normal" is a synonym for "none"; they  should  not
          be used in combination with any of the other attributes.

               To specify both a color and an attribute, use `&' to combine
          them.  To specify multiple attributes, use `+' to combine  those.
          For example: "magenta&inverse+dim".

               Note  that  the  display may substitute or ignore particular
          attributes depending upon its capabilities, and  in  general  may
          interpret  the attributes any way it wants.  For example, on some
          display systems a request for bold  might  yield  blink  or  vice
          versa.   On others, issuing an attribute request while another is
          already set up will replace the  earlier  attribute  rather  than
          combine with it.  Since NetHack issues attribute requests sequen-
          tially (at least with the tty interface) rather than all at once,
          the  only way a situation like that can be controlled is to spec-
          ify just one attribute.

               You can  adjust  the  appearance  of  the  following  status
          fields:
                     title       dungeon-level   experience-level
                    strength         gold           experience
                   dexterity       hitpoints            HD
                  constitution   hitpoints-max         time
                  intelligence       power            hunger
                     wisdom        power-max     carrying-capacity
                    charisma      armor-class        condition
                   alignment                           score

            The  pseudo-field  "characteristics" can be used to set all six
            of Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, and Cha  at  once.   "HD"  is  "hit
            dice",  an  approximation  of  experience  level displayed when
            polymorphed.  "experience", "time", and "score" are  condition-
            ally displayed depending upon your other option settings.

            Instead  of  a behavior, "condition" takes the following condi-
            tion flags: stone, slime,  strngl,  foodpois,  termill,  blind,
            deaf,  stun, conf, hallu, lev, fly, and ride.  You can use "ma-
            jor_troubles" as an  alias  for  stone  through  termill,  "mi-
            nor_troubles" for blind through hallu, "movement" for lev, fly,
            and ride, and "all" for every condition.

            Allowed behaviors are "always", "up", "down", "changed", a per-
            centage or absolute number threshold, or text to match against.

               * "always" will set the default attributes for that field.

               * "up",  "down"  set the field attributes for when the field
                 value changes upwards or downwards.  This attribute  times
                 out after statushilites turns.

               * "changed"  sets  the  field  attribute  for when the field
                 value   changes.    This   attribute   times   out   after


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                              93



                 statushilites  turns.   (If  a  field has both a "changed"
                 rule and an "up" or "down" rule which matches a change  in
                 the  field's  value,  the  "up" or "down" one takes prece-
                 dence.)

               * percentage sets the field attribute when the  field  value
                 matches  the  percentage.  It is specified as a number be-
                 tween 0 and 100, followed by `%' (percent sign).   If  the
                 percentage  is prefixed with `<=' or `>=', it also matches
                 when value is below or above the percentage.   Use  prefix
                 `<'  or  `>'  to match when strictly below or above.  (The
                 numeric limit is relaxed  slightly  for  those:  >-1%  and
                 <101%  are  allowed.)  Only four fields support percentage
                 rules.   Percentages  for  "hitpoints"  and  "power"   are
                 straightforward;  they're based on the corresponding maxi-
                 mum field.  Percentage highlight rules  are  also  allowed
                 for "experience level" and "experience points" (valid when
                 the showexp option is enabled).  For those, the percentage
                 is based on the progress from the start of the current ex-
                 perience level to the start of  the  next  level.   So  if
                 level  2  starts  at  20  points  and level 3 starts at 40
                 points, having 30 points is 50%  and  35  points  is  75%.
                 100%  is unattainable for experience because you'll gain a
                 level and the calculations will  be  reset  for  that  new
                 level,  but  a  rule  for =100% is allowed and matches the
                 special case of being exactly 1 experience point short  of
                 the next level.

               * absolute  value  sets  the  attribute when the field value
                 matches that number.  The number must be 0 or higher,  ex-
                 cept  for  "armor-class' which allows negative values, and
                 may optionally be preceded by `='.  If the number is  pre-
                 ceded  by `<=' or `>=' instead, it also matches when value
                 is below or above.  If the prefix  is  `<'  or  `>',  only
                 match when strictly above or below.

               * text match sets the attribute when the field value matches
                 the text.  Text matches can only be used for  "alignment",
                 "carrying-capacity",  "hunger",  "dungeon-level", and "ti-
                 tle".  For title, only the role's rank  title  is  tested;
                 the character's name is ignored.

               The  in-game options menu can help you determine the correct
          syntax for a configuration file.

               The whole feature can be disabled  by  setting  option  sta-
          tushilites to 0.

          9.14.  Modifying NetHack Symbols

               NetHack can load entire symbol sets from the symbol file.

               The  options that are used to select a particular symbol set
          from the symbol file are:

          symset
            Set the name of the symbol set that you want to load.

          roguesymset
            Set the name of the symbol set that you want to load  for  dis-
            play on the rogue level.

               You  can also override one or more symbols using the SYMBOLS
          and ROGUESYMBOLS configuration file options.  Symbols are  speci-
          fied as name:value pairs.  Note that NetHack escape-processes the
          value string in conventional C fashion.  This means that \  is  a
          prefix  to  take the following character literally.  Thus \ needs
          to be represented as \\.  The special prefix form \m switches  on
          the  meta  bit  in  the symbol value, and the ^ prefix causes the
          following character to be treated as a control character.

          x  S_xan                  (xan or other extraordinary insect)
          X  S_xorn                 (xorn)
          Y  S_yeti                 (apelike creature)
          Z  S_zombie               (zombie)
          z  S_zruty                (zruty)
             S_pet_override         (any pet if ACCESSIBILITY=1 is set)
             S_hero_override        (hero if ACCESSIBILITY=1 is set)

          Notes:

          * Several symbols in this table appear to be blank.  They are the
            space  character, except for S_pet_override and S_hero_override
            which don't have any default value and can only be used if  en-
            abled in the "sysconf" file.

          * S_rock  is  misleadingly  named;  rocks  and  stones use S_gem.
            Statues and boulders are the rock being referred to, but  since
            version  3.6.0,  statues  are displayed as the monster they de-
            pict.  So S_rock is only used for boulders and not used at  all
            if overridden by the more specific S_boulder.

          9.15.  Customizing Map Glyph Representations Using Unicode

               If  your  platform or terminal supports the display of UTF-8
          character sequences, you can customize your game display  by  as-
          signing  Unicode  codepoint  values  and red-green-blue colors to
          glyph representations. The customizations can  be  specified  for
          use with a symset that has a UTF8 handler within the symbols file
          such as the enhanced1 set, or individually within your nethack.rc
          file.


               The format for defining a glyph representation is:

          OPTIONS=glyph:glyphidU+nnnn/R-G-B

               The  window port that is active needs to provide support for
          displaying UTF-8 character sequences and explicit  red-green-blue
          colors  in order for the glyph representation to be visible.  For
          example, the following line in your configuration file will cause
          the  glyph representation for glyphid G_pool to use Unicode code-
          point U+224B and the color represented by R-G-B value 0-0-160

          OPTIONS=glyph:G_pool/U+224B/0-0-160

          The list of acceptable  glyphid's  can  be  produced  by  nethack
          --dumpglyphids.  Individual NetHack glyphs can be specified using
          the G_ prefix, or you can use an S_  symbol  for  a  glyphid  and
          store the custom representation for all NetHack glyphs that would
          map to that particular symbol.

          You will need to select a symset with a UTF8  handler  to  enable
          the display of the customizations, such as the Enhanced symset.

          9.16.  Configuring NetHack for Play by the Blind

               NetHack  can be set up to use only standard ASCII characters
          for making maps of the dungeons. This makes even the MS-DOS  ver-
          sions  of  NetHack  (which use special line-drawing characters by
          default) completely accessible to the blind who use speech and/or
          Braille access technologies.  Players will require a good working
          knowledge of their screen-reader's review features, and will have
          to  know how to navigate horizontally and vertically character by
          character. They will also find the search capabilities  of  their
          screen-readers  to  be quite valuable. Be certain to examine this
          Guidebook before playing so you have an idea what the screen lay-
          out is like. You'll also need to be able to locate the PC cursor.
          It is always where your character is  located.  Merely  searching
          for an @-sign will not always find your character since there are
          other humanoids represented by the same sign. Your  screen-reader
          should also have a function which gives you the row and column of
          your review cursor and the PC cursor.  These co-ordinates are of-
          ten  useful in giving players a better sense of the overall loca-
          tion of items on the screen.

               NetHack can also be compiled with support  for  sending  the
          game  messages  to  an external program, such as a text-to-speech
          synthesizer.  If the "#version" extended command shows  "external
          program  as  a  message  handler", your NetHack has been compiled
          with the capability.  When compiling NetHack from source on Linux
          and  other POSIX systems, define MSGHANDLER to enable it.  To use
          the capability, set the environment  variable  NETHACK_MSGHANDLER
          to an executable, which will be executed with the game message as
          the program's only parameter.

               The most crucial settings to make the game  more  accessible
          are:

          symset:plain
            Load a symbol set appropriate for use by blind players.

          menustyle:traditional
            This will assist in the interface to speech synthesizers.

          nomenu_overlay
            Show menus on a cleared screen and aligned to the left edge.

          number_pad
            A  lot  of  speech access programs use the number-pad to review
            the screen.  If this is the case, disable the number_pad option
            and use the traditional Rogue-like commands.

          paranoid_confirmation:swim
            Prevent walking into water or lava.

          autodescribe
            Automatically  describe  the terrain under the cursor when tar-
            geting.

          mention_walls
            Give feedback messages when walking  towards  a  wall  or  when
            travel command was interrupted.

          whatis_coord:compass
            When  targeting  with cursor, describe the cursor position with
            coordinates relative to your character.

          whatis_filter:area
            When targeting with cursor, filter possible locations  so  only
            those  in  the  same area (eg. same room, or same corridor) are
            considered.

          whatis_moveskip
            When targeting with cursor and using fast-move, skip  the  same
            glyphs instead of moving 8 units at a time.

          nostatus_updates
            Prevent  updates  to  the  status  lines  at  the bottom of the
            screen, if your screen-reader reads those lines. The  same  in-
            formation can be seen via the "#attributes" command.

          9.17.  Global Configuration for System Administrators

               If  NetHack  is compiled with the SYSCF option, a system ad-
          ministrator should set up a global configuration; this is a  file
          in the same format as the traditional per-user configuration file
          (see above).  This file should be named sysconf and placed in the
          same  directory  as the other NetHack support files.  The options
          recognized in this file are listed below.   Any  option  not  set
          uses a compiled-in default (which may not be appropriate for your
          system).

            WIZARDS = A space-separated list of user names who are  allowed
            to play in debug mode (commonly referred to as wizard mode).  A
            value of a single asterisk (*) allows anyone to start a game in
            debug mode.

            SHELLERS = A list of users who are allowed to use the shell es-
            cape command (!).  The syntax is the same as WIZARDS.

            EXPLORERS = A list of users who are allowed to use the  explore
            mode.  The syntax is the same as WIZARDS.

            MAXPLAYERS = Limit the maximum number of games that can be run-
            ning at the same time.

            SAVEFORMAT = A list of up to two save file formats separated by
            space.   The  first  format in the list will written as well as
            read. The second format will be read only if no  save  file  in
            the  first  format  exists.  Valid choices are "historical" for
            binary writing of entire structs, "lendian" for binary  writing
            of  each  field in little-endian order, "ascii" for writing the
            save file content in ascii text.


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                             101



            BONESFORMAT = A list of up to two bones file formats  separated
            by space.  The first format in the list will written as well as
            read. The second format will be read only if no bones files  in
            the first format exist.  Valid choices are "historical" for bi-
            nary writing of entire structs, "lendian" for binary writing of
            each  field  in  little-endian  order,  "ascii" for writing the
            bones file content in ascii text.

            SUPPORT = A string explaining how to get local support (no  de-
            fault value).

            RECOVER = A  string  explaining  how  to recover a game on this
            system (no default value).

            SEDUCE = 0 or 1 to disable or enable, respectively, the  SEDUCE
            option.  When disabled, incubi and succubi behave like nymphs.

            CHECK_PLNAME = Setting  this to 1 will make the EXPLORERS, WIZ-
            ARDS, and SHELLERS check for the player  name  instead  of  the
            user's login name.

            CHECK_SAVE_UID = 0 or 1 to disable or enable, respectively, the
            UID (used identification number) checking for  save  files  (to
            verify  that  the  user  who  is  restoring is the same one who
            saved).

               The following four options affect the score file:

            PERSMAX = Maximum number of entries for one person.

            ENTRYMAX = Maximum number of entries in the score file.

            POINTSMIN = Minimum number of points to get  an  entry  in  the
            score file.

            PERS_IS_UID = 0  or 1 to use user names or numeric userids, re-
            spectively, to identify unique people for the score file.

            HIDEUSAGE = 0 or 1 to control whether the help menu  entry  for
            command line usage is shown or suppressed.

            MAX_STATUENAME_RANK = Maximum  number  of score file entries to
            use for random statue names (default is 10).

            ACCESSIBILITY = 0 or 1 to disable or enable, respectively,  the
            ability  for  players to set S_pet_override and S_hero_override
            symbols in their configuration file.

            PORTABLE_DEVICE_PATHS = 0 or 1 Windows OS only, the  game  will
            look  for  all  of  its external files, and write to all of its
            output files in one place rather than  at  the  standard  loca-
            tions.




          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                             102



            DUMPLOGFILE = A  filename  where  the  end-of-game  dumplog  is
            saved.  Not defining this will prevent dumplog from being  cre-
            ated.   Only  available  if your game is compiled with DUMPLOG.
            Allows the following placeholders:

                %% - literal `%'
                %v - version (eg. "3.7.0-0")
                %u - game UID
                %t - game start time, UNIX timestamp format
                %T - current time, UNIX timestamp format
                %d - game start time, YYYYMMDDhhmmss format
                %D - current time, YYYYMMDDhhmmss format
                %n - player name
                %N - first character of player name

            LIVELOG = A bit-mask of types of events that should be  written
            to the livelog file if one is present.  The sample sysconf file
            accompanying the program contains a  comment  which  lists  the
            meaning  of the various bits used.  Intended for server systems
            supporting simultaneous play by multiple players (to be  clear,
            each one running a separate single player game), for displaying
            their game progress to observers.  Only relevant if the program
            was  built  with LIVELOG enabled.  When available, it should be
            left commented out on single player installations because  over
            time the file could grow to be extremely large unless it is ac-
            tively maintained.

          10.  Scoring

               NetHack maintains a list of the top  scores  or  scorers  on
          your machine, depending on how it is set up.  In the latter case,
          each account on the machine can post only one  non-winning  score
          on  this  list.   If  you  score higher than someone else on this
          list, or better your previous score, you will be inserted in  the
          proper  place  under your current name.  How many scores are kept
          can also be set up when NetHack is compiled.

               Your score is chiefly based upon  how  much  experience  you
          gained, how much loot you accumulated, how deep you explored, and
          how the game ended.  If you quit the game, you escape with all of
          your  gold  intact.   If, however, you get killed in the Mazes of
          Menace, the guild will only hear about 90% of your gold when your
          corpse  is  discovered  (adventurers  have  been known to collect
          finder's fees).  So, consider whether you want to take  one  last
          hit  at  that  monster  and  possibly live, or quit and stop with
          whatever you have.  If you quit, you keep all your gold,  but  if
          you swing and live, you might find more.

               If  you  just want to see what the current top players/games
          list is, you can type nethack -s all on most versions.






          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023





          NetHack Guidebook                                             103



          11.  Explore mode

               NetHack is an intricate and difficult game.   Novices  might
          falter in fear, aware of their ignorance of the means to survive.
          Well, fear not.  Your dungeon comes equipped with an "explore" or
          "discovery"  mode  that  enables  you  to keep old save files and
          cheat death, at the paltry cost of not getting on the high  score
          list.

               There  are  two  ways  of  enabling explore mode.  One is to
          start the game with the -X command-line switch or with the  play-
          mode:explore  option.   The  other is to issue the "#exploremode"
          extended command while already playing the game.  Starting a  new
          game in explore mode provides your character with a wand of wish-
          ing in initial inventory; switching during play  does  not.   The
          other  benefits of explore mode are left for the trepid reader to
          discover.

          11.1.  Debug mode

               Debug mode, also known as wizard mode, is undocumented aside
          from  this  brief  description  and the various "debug mode only"
          commands listed among the command descriptions.  It  is  intended
          for tracking down problems within the program rather than to pro-
          vide god-like powers to your character, and players  who  attempt
          debugging  are  expected  to figure out how to use it themselves.
          It is initiated by starting the game  with  the  -D  command-line
          switch or with the playmode:debug option.

               For  some systems, the player must be logged in under a par-
          ticular user name to be allowed to use debug  mode;  for  others,
          the  hero  must  be given a particular character name (but may be
          any role; there's no connection between  "wizard  mode"  and  the
          Wizard  role).  Attempting to start a game in debug mode when not
          allowed or not available will result in falling back  to  explore
          mode instead.

          12.  Credits

               The  original  hack  game  was  modeled on the Berkeley UNIX
          rogue game.  Large portions of  this  document  were  shamelessly
          cribbed  from  A Guide to the Dungeons of Doom, by Michael C. Toy
          and Kenneth C. R. C. Arnold.  Small portions  were  adapted  from
          Further Exploration of the Dungeons of Doom, by Ken Arromdee.

               NetHack is the product of literally scores of people's work.
          Main events in the course of the game development  are  described
          below:

               Jay  Fenlason  wrote the original Hack, with help from Kenny
          Woodland, Mike Thome, and Jon Payne.

               Andries Brouwer did a  major  re-write  while  at  Stichting
          Mathematisch   Centrum  (now  Centrum  Wiskunde  &  Informatica),


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023

          transforming Hack into a very different game.  He  published  the
          Hack  source  code  for  use  on  UNIX systems by posting that to
          Usenet newsgroup net.sources (later renamed comp.sources) releas-
          ing  version 1.0 in December of 1984, then versions 1.0.1, 1.0.2,
          and  finally  1.0.3  in   July   of   1985.    Usenet   newsgroup
          net.games.hack (later renamed rec.games.hack, eventually replaced
          by rec.games.roguelike.nethack) was created for discussing it.

               Don G. Kneller ported Hack 1.0.3 to Microsoft C and  MS-DOS,
          producing  PC  HACK 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics
          in version 1.03g, and went on to produce at least four more  ver-
          sions (3.0, 3.2, 3.51, and 3.6; note that these are old Hack ver-
          sion numbers, not contemporary NetHack ones).

               R. Black ported PC HACK 3.51 to  Lattice  C  and  the  Atari
          520/1040ST, producing ST Hack 1.03.

               Mike Stephenson merged these various versions back together,
          incorporating many of the added features,  and  produced  NetHack
          version  1.4 in 1987.  He then coordinated a cast of thousands in
          enhancing and debugging NetHack 1.4 and released NetHack versions
          2.2  and  2.3.   Like  Hack,  they were released by posting their
          source code to Usenet where they remained  available  in  various
          archives  accessible  via  ftp  and  uucp after expiring from the
          newsgroup.

               Later, Mike coordinated a major re-write of the game,  head-
          ing  a  team which included Ken Arromdee, Jean-Christophe Collet,
          Steve Creps, Eric Hendrickson, Izchak Miller,  Eric  S.  Raymond,
          John  Rupley, Mike Threepoint, and Janet Walz, to produce NetHack
          3.0c.

               NetHack 3.0 was ported to the Atari by  Eric  R.  Smith,  to
          OS/2  by  Timo Hakulinen, and to VMS by David Gentzel.  The three
          of them and Kevin Darcy later joined the main NetHack Development
          Team to produce subsequent revisions of 3.0.

               Olaf  Seibert ported NetHack 2.3 and 3.0 to the Amiga.  Norm
          Meluch, Stephen Spackman and Pierre  Martineau  designed  overlay
          code  for  PC  NetHack 3.0.  Johnny Lee ported NetHack 3.0 to the
          Macintosh.  Along with various other Dungeoneers, they  continued
          to  enhance  the PC, Macintosh, and Amiga ports through the later
          revisions of 3.0.

               Version 3.0 went through  ten  relatively  rapidly  released
          "patch-level"  revisions.  Versions at the time were known as 3.0
          for the base release and  variously  as  "3.0a"  through  "3.0j",
          "3.0 patchlevel 1"   through   "3.0 patchlevel 10",  or  "3.0pl1"
          through "3.0pl10" rather than 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 through 3.0.10; the
          three component numbering scheme began to be used with 3.1.0.

               Headed  by  Mike Stephenson and coordinated by Izchak Miller
          and Janet Walz, the NetHack Development Team which  now  included
          Ken  Arromdee,  David Cohrs, Jean-Christophe Collet, Kevin Darcy,

          Matt Day, Timo Hakulinen, Steve Linhart, Dean Luick, Pat  Rankin,
          Eric Raymond, and Eric Smith undertook a radical revision of 3.0.
          They re-structured the game's design, and re-wrote major parts of
          the  code.   They added multiple dungeons, a new display, special
          individual character quests, a new endgame  and  many  other  new
          features,  and  produced NetHack 3.1.  Version 3.1.0 was released
          in January of 1993.

               Ken Lorber, Gregg Wonderly and Greg Olson,  with  help  from
          Richard  Addison,  Mike  Passaretti,  and Olaf Seibert, developed
          NetHack 3.1 for the Amiga.

               Norm Meluch and Kevin Smolkowski, with help from Carl  Sche-
          lin, Stephen Spackman, Steve VanDevender, and Paul Winner, ported
          NetHack 3.1 to the PC.

               Jon W{tte and Hao-yang Wang, with help from Ross Brown, Mike
          Engber,  David  Hairston, Michael Hamel, Jonathan Handler, Johnny
          Lee, Tim Lennan, Rob Menke, and Andy Swanson,  developed  NetHack
          3.1 for the Macintosh, porting it for MPW.  Building on their de-
          velopment, Bart House added a Think C port.

               Timo Hakulinen ported  NetHack  3.1  to  OS/2.   Eric  Smith
          ported  NetHack  3.1  to  the  Atari.  Pat Rankin, with help from
          Joshua Delahunty, was responsible for the VMS version of  NetHack
          3.1.  Michael Allison ported NetHack 3.1 to Windows NT.

               Dean  Luick,  with  help from David Cohrs, developed NetHack
          3.1 for X11.  It drew the map as text rather than graphically but
          included  nh10.bdf,  an optionally used custom X11 font which has
          tiny images in place of letters and punctuation, a  precursor  of
          tiles.   Those  images don't extend to individual monster and ob-
          ject types, just replacements for monster and object classes  (so
          one  custom image for all "a" insects and another for all "[" ar-
          mor and so forth, not separate images for beetles and ants or for
          cloaks and boots).

               Warwick  Allison  wrote  a  graphically displayed version of
          NetHack for the Atari where the tiny pictures were  described  as
          "icons"  and were distinct for specific types of monsters and ob-
          jects rather than just their classes.  He contributed them to the
          NetHack  Development Team which rechristened them "tiles", origi-
          nal usage which has subsequently been picked up by various  other
          games.   NetHack's  tiles  support  was then implemented on other
          platforms (initially MS-DOS but eventually Windows, Qt,  and  X11
          too).

               The 3.2 NetHack Development Team, comprised of Michael Alli-
          son, Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Steve Creps, Kevin
          Darcy,  Timo  Hakulinen,  Steve  Linhart, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin,
          Eric Smith, Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz,  and  Paul  Winner,  re-
          leased version 3.2.0 in April of 1996.

               Version 3.2 marked the tenth anniversary of the formation of
          the development team.  In a testament to their dedication to  the
          game,  all  thirteen  members of the original NetHack Development
          Team remained on the team at the start of work on  that  release.
          During  the  interval between the release of 3.1.3 and 3.2.0, one
          of the founding members of  the  NetHack  Development  Team,  Dr.
          Izchak  Miller,  was diagnosed with cancer and passed away.  That
          release of the game was dedicated to him by the  development  and
          porting teams.

               Version 3.2 proved to be more stable than previous versions.
          Many bugs were fixed, abuses eliminated, and game features  tuned
          for better game play.

               During the lifespan of NetHack 3.1 and 3.2, several enthusi-
          asts of the game added their own modifications to  the  game  and
          made these "variants" publicly available:

               Tom  Proudfoot  and  Yuval Oren created NetHack++, which was
          quickly renamed NetHack-- when some  people  incorrectly  assumed
          that  it  was  a conversion of the C source code to C++.  Working
          independently, Stephen White wrote NetHack Plus.   Tom  Proudfoot
          later merged NetHack Plus and his own NetHack-- to produce SLASH.
          Larry Stewart-Zerba and Warwick Allison improved the spell  cast-
          ing  system  with  the Wizard Patch.  Warwick Allison also ported
          NetHack to use the Qt interface.

               Warren Cheung combined SLASH with the Wizard Patch  to  pro-
          duce  Slash'EM,  and with the help of Kevin Hugo, added more fea-
          tures.  Kevin later joined the NetHack Development Team  and  in-
          corporated the best of these ideas into NetHack 3.3.

               The final update to 3.2 was the bug fix release 3.2.3, which
          was released simultaneously with 3.3.0 in December 1999  just  in
          time  for the Year 2000.  Because of the newer version, 3.2.3 was
          released as a source code patch only, without  any  ready-to-play
          distribution for systems that usually had such.

               (To  anyone  considering  resurrecting  an old version:  all
          versions before 3.2.3 had a Y2K bug.  The high  scores  file  and
          the  log  file  contained dates which were formatted using a two-
          digit year, and 1999's year 99 was followed by 2000's  year  100.
          That  got  written out successfully but it unintentionally intro-
          duced an extra column in the file layout  which  prevented  score
          entries  from  being read back in correctly, interfering with in-
          sertion of new high scores and with retrieval  of  old  character
          names  to  use  for  random ghost and statue names in the current
          game.)

               The 3.3 NetHack Development Team, consisting of Michael  Al-
          lison,  Ken  Arromdee,  David  Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Steve Creps,
          Kevin Darcy, Timo Hakulinen, Kevin Hugo, Steve Linhart, Ken  Lor-
          ber,  Dean  Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Smith, Mike Stephenson, Janet
          Walz, and Paul Winner, released 3.3.0 in December 1999 and  3.3.1

          in August of 2000.

               Version 3.3 offered many firsts. It was the first version to
          separate race and profession. The Elf class was removed in  pref-
          erence to an elf race, and the races of dwarves, gnomes, and orcs
          made their first appearance in the game  alongside  the  familiar
          human  race.  Monk and Ranger roles joined Archeologists, Barbar-
          ians,  Cavemen,  Healers,  Knights,  Priests,  Rogues,   Samurai,
          Tourists,  Valkyries  and  of  course,  Wizards.  It was also the
          first version to allow you to ride a steed,  and  was  the  first
          version  to  have  a  publicly available web-site listing all the
          bugs that had been discovered.  Despite that  constantly  growing
          bug  list,  3.3 proved stable enough to last for more than a year
          and a half.

               The 3.4 NetHack  Development  Team  initially  consisted  of
          Michael  Allison, Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Kevin
          Hugo, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Mike Stephenson,  Janet
          Walz,  and Paul Winner, with  Warwick Allison joining just before
          the release of NetHack 3.4.0 in March 2002.

               As with version 3.3, various people contributed to the  game
          as a whole as well as supporting ports on the different platforms
          that NetHack runs on:

               Pat Rankin maintained 3.4 for VMS.

               Michael Allison maintained NetHack 3.4 for the MS-DOS  plat-
          form.  Paul Winner and Yitzhak Sapir provided encouragement.

               Dean  Luick, Mark Modrall, and Kevin Hugo maintained and en-
          hanced the Macintosh port of 3.4.

               Michael Allison, David Cohrs, Alex  Kompel,  Dion  Nicolaas,
          and  Yitzhak  Sapir maintained and enhanced 3.4 for the Microsoft
          Windows platform.  Alex Kompel contributed a new graphical inter-
          face  for  the Windows port.  Alex Kompel also contributed a Win-
          dows CE port for 3.4.1.

               Ron Van Iwaarden was the sole maintainer of NetHack for OS/2
          the  past several releases. Unfortunately Ron's last OS/2 machine
          stopped working in early 2006. A great many  thanks  to  Ron  for
          keeping NetHack alive on OS/2 all these years.

               Janne  Salmijarvi  and  Teemu Suikki maintained and enhanced
          the Amiga port of 3.4 after Janne Salmijarvi resurrected  it  for
          3.3.1.

               Christian "Marvin" Bressler maintained 3.4 for the Atari af-
          ter he resurrected it for 3.3.1.

               The release of NetHack 3.4.3 in December 2003 marked the be-
          ginning of a long release hiatus. 3.4.3 proved to be a remarkably
          stable version that provided continued enjoyment by the community


          NetHack 3.7.0                                      March 16, 2023

          for  more  than a decade. The NetHack Development Team slowly and
          quietly continued to work on the game behind  the  scenes  during
          the  tenure of 3.4.3. It was during that same period that several
          new  variants  emerged  within  the  NetHack  community.  Notably
          sporkhack by Derek S. Ray, unnethack by Patric Mueller, nitrohack
          and its successors originally by Daniel Thaler and then  by  Alex
          Smith,  and Dynahack by Tung Nguyen.  Some of those variants con-
          tinue to be developed, maintained, and enjoyed by  the  community
          to this day.

               In September 2014, an interim snapshot of the code under de-
          velopment was released publicly by  other  parties.   Since  that
          code  was a work-in-progress and had not gone through the process
          of debugging it as a suitable release, it was  decided  that  the
          version  numbers  present  on that code snapshot would be retired
          and never used in an official NetHack release.   An  announcement
          was posted on the NetHack Development Team's official nethack.org
          website to that effect, stating  that  there  would  never  be  a
          3.4.4, 3.5, or 3.5.0 official release version.

               In  January  2015,  preparation  began  for  the  release of
          NetHack 3.6.

               At the beginning of development for  what  would  eventually
          get  released as 3.6.0, the NetHack Development Team consisted of
          Warwick Allison, Michael  Allison,  Ken  Arromdee,  David  Cohrs,
          Jessie  Collet, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Mike Stephen-
          son, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner.  In early 2015,  ahead  of  the
          release of 3.6.0, new members Sean Hunt, Pasi Kallinen, and Derek
          S. Ray joined the NetHack Development Team.

               Near the end of the development of 3.6.0, one of the signif-
          icant  inspirations  for  many  of  the humorous and fun features
          found in the game, author Terry Pratchett, passed away.   NetHack
          3.6.0 introduced a tribute to him.

               3.6.0 was released in December 2015, and merged work done by
          the development team since the release of 3.4.3 with some of  the
          beloved community patches. Many bugs were fixed and some code was
          restructured.

               The NetHack Development Team, as well as  Steve  VanDevender
          and Kevin Smolkowski, ensured that NetHack 3.6 continued to oper-
          ate on various UNIX flavors and maintained the X11 interface.

               Ken Lorber, Haoyang Wang, Pat Rankin, and Dean  Luick  main-
          tained the port of NetHack 3.6 for MacOS.

               Michael  Allison,  David  Cohrs,  Bart House, Pasi Kallinen,
          Alex Kompel, Dion Nicolaas, Derek S. Ray and Yitzhak Sapir  main-
          tained the port of NetHack 3.6 for Microsoft Windows.

               Pat  Rankin  attempted  to  keep  the  VMS  port running for
          NetHack 3.6, hindered by limited  access.  Kevin  Smolkowski  has

          updated  and  tested  it  for  the most recent version of OpenVMS
          (V8.4 as of this writing) on Alpha and Integrity (aka Itanium aka
          IA64) but not VAX.

               Ray  Chason resurrected the MS-DOS port for 3.6 and contrib-
          uted the necessary updates to the community at large.

               In late April 2018, several hundred bug fixes for 3.6.0  and
          some  new  features were assembled and released as NetHack 3.6.1.
          The NetHack Development Team at the time of release of 3.6.1 con-
          sisted  of  Warwick Allison, Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee, David
          Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Pasi  Kallinen,  Ken  Lorber,  Dean  Luick,
          Patric  Mueller,  Pat  Rankin,  Derek  S.  Ray,  Alex Smith, Mike
          Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner.

               In early May 2019, another 320 bug fixes along with some en-
          hancements  and  the adopted curses window port, were released as
          3.6.2.

               Bart House, who had contributed to the  game  as  a  porting
          team participant for decades, joined the NetHack Development Team
          in late May 2019.

               NetHack 3.6.3 was released on December  5,  2019  containing
          over 190 bug fixes to NetHack 3.6.2.

               NetHack 3.6.4 was released on December 18, 2019 containing a
          security fix and a few bug fixes.

               NetHack 3.6.5 was released on January  27,  2020  containing
          some security fixes and a small number of bug fixes.

               NetHack 3.6.6 was released on March 8, 2020 containing a se-
          curity fix and some bug fixes.

               NetHack 3.6.7 was released on February 16, 2023 containing a
          security fix and some bug fixes.

          12.2.  Dungeoneers

               From  time  to  time,  some depraved individual out there in
          netland sends a particularly intriguing modification to help  out
          with the game.  The NetHack Development Team sometimes makes note
          of the names of the worst of these miscreants in this,  the  list
          of Dungeoneers:
