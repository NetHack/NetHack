This fixes36.4 file is here to capture information about updates in the 3.6.x
lineage following the release of 3.6.3 in December 2019.  Hypothetical version
3.6.4 may not be released, in which case these fixes will appear in 3.7.0.

General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
GDBPATH and GREPPATH from sysconf or -D... on compilation command line were
	being processed even if PANICTRACE was disabled but only being freed
	at end of game when that was enabled
fix the article used in the message when your steed encounters a polymorph trap
alloc teleporting onto the vibrating square
message "your knapsack can't accomodate any more items" when picking stuff up
	or removing such from container was inaccurate if there was some gold
	pending; vary the message rather than add more convoluted pickup code
dozen-ish assorted spelling/typo fixes in messages and source comments
