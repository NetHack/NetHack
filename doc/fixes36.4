	at end of game when that was enabled
fix the article used in the message when your steed encounters a polymorph trap
allow teleporting onto the vibrating square
message "your knapsack can't accomodate any more items" when picking stuff up
	or removing such from container was inaccurate if there was some gold
	pending; vary the message rather than add more convoluted pickup code
dozen-ish assorted spelling/typo fixes in messages and source comments
fix potential buffer overflow when parsing run-time configuration file
wizard mode wishing for terrain would leave it unmapped if done while blind
wizard mode terrain wish could leave hero in water (severe vision limits) or
	in lava (trapped, sinking) which wasn't there any more
flying hero can go down (via '>') holes or trap doors instead of escaping trap
polymorphed hero hiding on the ceiling can now use '>' to unhide instead of
	being told "you can't go down here"
