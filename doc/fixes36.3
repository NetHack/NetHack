$NHDT-Branch: NetHack-3.6 $:$NHDT-Revision: 1.41 $ $NHDT-Date: 1559733390 2019/06/05 11:16:30 $

This fixes36.3 file is here to capture information about updates in the 3.6.x
lineage following the release of 3.6.2 in May 2019. Please note, however,
that another 3.6.x release is not anticipated, and most developer
focus will shift to the next major release.

General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
when place_object() puts a non-boulder on the map at a spot which contains
	other objects, put it under all boulders in the pile rather than just
	under the top one; previously, map wasn't showing a boulder there if
	the top one got moved by means other than pushing
when examining the map with '/' or ';', picking a symbol which is used for
	more than 4 things yielded a sentence lacking its terminating period
billing and payment issue as a result of glob coalescing
glob pricing did not consider weight properly
glob shop interaction improved to handle more of the expected scenarios
non-flying steed on Plane of Water would drown when air bubble moved hero
xans fly, but could not reach your feet if you flew
adjust vortex database entry to be consistent with fire and energy vortices
when co-located with a boulder you could sometimes swap places with pets of
	any size
on rare occasions, multiple mine's end luckstones were being marked as the
	prize and triggering an impossible() on a public server
make sure the correct luckstone is the prize in mine's end
free dungeon overview's bones information at end of game
free current level's bones information at end of game
free ball and chain if Punished hero dies while descending stairs or dies or
	quits while swallowed; put ball and chain in bones for the stairs case
if hero dies while a thrown or kicked object is in transit, put that object
	on the map in case bones data gets saved
fix a memory leak that occurred if player used wizard mode to leave and return
	to the Plane of Air or Plane of Water (not possible in normal play)
free sortloot data if object handling is short-circuited by cockatrice corpse
on the Plane of Water, make water go all the way to the edges of the level
on the Plane of Air, make clouds disrupt line of sight along the edges
have '&' (whatdoes) command describe movement keystrokes instead of reporting
	them as unknown or showing their number_pad action when that is Off
some improvement to the handling of endgame levels filling up with monsters
if you survive turning into green slime due to life-saving (surviving as a
	green slime) then die again due to green slimes having been genocided,
	the feedback was strange because it assumed that the prior message
	came from answering No to "Really die?" in explore or wizard mode
various cases where objects had their bless/curse state become known weren't
	updating persistent inventory window, when enabled, to reflect changes
	(cited case was trying to remove cursed armor and being told of the
	curse but there were lots of other situations with the same issue)
similar perm_invent issue when lock state known and/or contents known become
	set for carried container
blessed scroll of remove curse read while confused might be shown to operate
	on itself by perm_invent after player is told that it has disappeared
fix memory leak if corpse auto-revival attempt failed ("you feel less hassled")
allow a parent function to issue an an unplacebc() call that restricts
	subsequent placebc() calls to that parent only
flying monsters could enter water on the Plane of Water but then they'd drown
	unless they could also swim or else didn't need to breathe
when finding a place to put a monster on the Plane of Water, don't pick a
	water location for flyers or floaters (levitate) or clingers (ceiling)


Fixes to Post-3.6.2 Problems that Were Exposed Via git Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------
elemental_clog() loop needed to guard against obliteration of the monster
	that was trying to be placed
curses: sometimes the message window would show a blank line after a prompt


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes or Features
-----------------------------------------------------
curses: very tall menus tried to use selector characters a-z, A-Z, and 0-9,
	but 0-9 should be reserved for counts and if the display was tall
	enough for more than 62 entries, arbitrary ASCII punctuation got used
curses: when all available lines in the message window are in use,
	autodescribe feedback for 'pick a position with cursor' overwrote
	the last line (usually the 'pick a position' prompt/hint), sometimes
	leaving part of longer underlying line's text visible
curses: if message window is only one line, cancelling some prompts with ESC
	left the prompts visible on the message line instead of erasing them
curses: support EDIT_GETLIN (but like with tty, it's disabled by default) to
	pre-load an earlier response as the default answer for some prompts
	(however, it's skipped if the 'popup_dialog' option is On)
curses: when display windows get reconfigured (after setting align_status,
	align_message, statuslines, windowborders or due to external resize),
	the message window was being refreshed with the oldest available N
	messages rather than most recent N.  [Still room for improvement;
	when feasible it combines short lines, resulting in N messages on
	fewer than N lines and leaving some of the available lines blank.]
curses: plug memory leak when getting a line of input is cancelled by ESC
curses: after requesting a line of input from player, next line of message
	window could end up being skipped
tty: re-do one optimization used when status conditions have all been removed
	and remove another that tried to check whether condition text to be
	displayed next was the same as the existing value; sometimes new
	status condition wouldn't be shown unless a screen redraw was forced
Windows: some startup error messages were not being delivered successfully


General New Features
--------------------
classify sources as released, beta, or work-in-progress via NH_DEVEL_STATUS
	rather than just released vs beta via BETA
if you reach the edge of a level (relatively uncommon) and try to move off,
	report that you can't go farther if the 'mention_walls' option is set


NetHack Community Patches (or Variation) Included
-------------------------------------------------
add a couple of engraving suggestions in pull request #79


Code Cleanup and Reorganization
-------------------------------
began to add some function caller BREADCRUMBS to aid debugging
