eating tainted black pudding (glob in 3.6.0, corpse in 3.4.x and 3.3.x)

	dungeon but ended up arriving on Plane of Earth
monster hitting fire-dealing monster with weapon triggered passive damage to
	weapon every time, when hero doing so only had 1/6 chance per hit
hitting steam vortex with flammable weapon would damage the weapon with fire
if a non-cursed spellbook being read becomes cursed and hero recognizes that
	(bknown is set), interrupt reading

vortexes and other unsolid monsters need not avoid webs
barbarian and samurai can achieve basic in their special spell's skill
scalpel and tsurugi can now split puddings; bashing with darts or arrows can't
jumping while punished could leave ball and chain in the wrong place
improve Deaf message handling for the minetown watch and shops
issues with Warning when you're adjacent to an undetected hider; clearly you
	are aware a monster is present so this causes you to search it out
allow lookup of names like Hachi when selecting monsters from the map
lookup "More Info?" prompt will now tell you what it will look for on 'y'
using 'R' on armor would bypass some restrictions imposed by 'T' (inner layer
	could be taken off from under outer layer, embedded scales could be

when examining hidden monsters (probing, persistent monster detection), tell
	how they're hidden (under an object, on the ceiling, etc)

if a long worm inherited inventory from a previous shape, and if an egg or

	incremented when new stun or confusion damage was suffered

	displayed an inventory of everything rather than just worn items (or
	not fully identified items)
exploding chest trap would destroy uchain while still worn if uball carried
if monster shapechange message "<foo> turns into <bar>!" was given, <bar>
	could be "it" (if <foo> sensed telepathically and <bar> is mindless)

sortloot changed to place diluted potion of foo after potion of foo instead
	of listing all diluted potions followed by all non-diluted ones
digging down on a grave converted the terrain to floor but did not create a
	pit and uncover the grave's contents; digging again--on floor--did
when feel_location removed a remembered-unseen-monster glyph from a known
	water location while hero was levitating, the map was redrawn showing
	floor instead of water at that spot
Vlad's tower2 and tower3 didn't show up in wizard-mode ^O output or ^V? menu
remove extra space from "All of your  <stack-of-potions> boil and explode."
	(also applies to potions freezing and to scrolls burning)
effects of cursed potion of levitation were skipped if already levitating
when engulfed, having swallower be killed by angry deity trying to zap hero
	no longer violates pacifist conduct (other penalties--reduced luck or
	alignment--still apply if target is something you shouldn't kill)
likewise when a monster kills inself trying to prevent turning to stone or
	into slime that's been caused by the player, pacifism is not affected
metabolism adjustments: hero poly'd into metallivore form still needs to eat;
	being fainted or unconscious from other than sleep now consumes
	nutrition at lower rate, like being asleep already did;
	starvation threshold shortened due to slower food use while fainting
after using detection magic or #terrain while underwater, then leaving water
	and saving while on land, save would flag you as underwater again and
	then restore would limit the map display accordingly; next move would
	notice, retify things, and report "you are on solid land again"
change #terrain used while underwater to view the regular map rather than the
	crippled underwater one
can see or feel adjacent lava or ice when underwater
farlook when underwater now reports "land" for adjacent non-{water,lava,ice}
	and "unreconnoitered" for non-adjacent anything, instead of "dark part
	of a room" for the former and either dark-room or "unexplored" for the
	latter depending upon whether the spot had previously been scouted
monster who accidentally killed itself by zapping wand of fire or fire horn
	at self to prevent turning into slime was not properly killed off;
	it wouldn't benefit from an amulet of life saving and would trigger
	impossible "dmonsfree: N removed doesn't match M pending"
resurrecting a shopkeeper corpse caused crash (replmon -> replshk -> inhishop
	-> no eshk data for temporary monster being replaced with revived shk)
new character with OPTIONS=role:Valk,race:!human,align:!lawful yielded
	"Shall I pick your Dwarven Valkyrie's for you?" where !human forces
	dwarf and dwarf forces lawful, contradicting align:!lawful
new character with OPTIONS=role:Valk,race:random yielded
	"Shall I pick your Valkyrie's race and alignment for you?" instead
	of honoring race:random without asking
while in shop, undead turning at self causing carried, hero owned corpse to
	resurrect claimed it belonged to shopkeeper
while in shop, stone-to-flesh at self causing carried, hero owned figurine
	or statue to animate claimed it belonged to shopkeeper
reviving one of a stack of N corpses in a shop charged a usage fee for all N;
	remaining N-1 were owned by hero if carried but by shop if on floor
gremlin wailing in agony should wake up nearby monsters
add more lighting variance to the second bigroom variant
when getpos was picking a location, typing '^' to move to the next known trap
	skipped some detected traps if their location was unseen
describe detected door traps and chest traps as trapped door and trapped chest
	instead of bear trap; bear trap tile is still used on map though
thrown potion that killed peaceful monster would cause "the <mon> gets argry"
	after the message about it being killed
when poly'd into a hider and engulfed, attempt to hide via #monster was blocked
	but feedback said "can't hide while held" rather than "while engulfed"
various monster/object/food/gold/trap detections were inconsistent in how they
	behaved if performed while engulfed or underwater
show in inventory which monster a leash is attached to
using /? to look up something by name, supplying multiple spaces (with no
	other characters) as the name triggered impossible "singular of null?"
add support for the 'altmeta' option to the 'what-does' command ('&' or '?f')
when wielded weapon becomes untouchable (after alignment change or polymorph)
	hero could be 'blasted by its power' twice in succession
at startup, if sysconf had been read but user's own config file couldn't be
	read, sysconf got processed again as if it contained user's options
don't give "you cannot pass through the bars" when travel is testing possible
	paths in the vicinity of iron bars
if blind and no gloves, using 'm<dir>' to move and then 'e' could be used to
	locate cockatrice corpse without fatal touching (by declining to eat)
it's cannabilism for a were<foo> to eat a <foo> corpse
conduct: wishing for an artifact and not getting it because it already exists
	counts as wishing for an artifact, just like when not getting it
	because of quest restrictions or too many artifacts in play does
avoid ring of poison resistance as starting equipment for orcish wizard
gelatinous cube shouldn't be able to eat a scroll of scare monster
make fireballs or cones of cold cast a skilled or higher not go through walls
prevent flying monsters from hovering over unreachable underwater objects
lembas wafer gives increased nutrition to elves, reduced nutrition to orcs;
	cram ration gives increase nutrition to dwarves
when #tip's terse object drop format got interrupted by a regular message,
	it continued using "obj2, obj3, ..." for subsequent objects, where
	the sentence grammar no longer made sense (the interrupting message
	still follows the comma of a partial sentence--attempting to fix that
	seems hopeless; leaving it is better than always using verbose format)
for #tip inside shop, credit was incorrectly given for spilled gold if that
	gold's stale location coordinates didn't happen to be inside the shop
when confused scroll of light summoned lights, player would be asked what to
	call the scroll even if scroll of light was already identified
if a visible monster becomes invisible, mark its spot with the 'remembered,
	unseen monster' glyph ('I' character or '?' tile)
monsters can throw cockatrice eggs at hero, but there was no handling for eggs
	when the missile hit an intervening monster
clarify that shape-shifted vampires revert to vampire form when petrified or
	digested; when back in 'V' form, they're vulnerable to such damage
when poly'd into an engulfer which does digestion damage, a kill resulting in
	a level gain gave "welcome to level N+1" before "you digest <victim>"
any corpse eaten by omnivorous hero always tasted "terrible"
eating the corpse of a unique non-named monster (Wizard of Yendor, Oracle,
	Chromatic Dragon, others) gave "The the <monster corpse> tastes ..."
when escaping the dungeon, change "you were here" annotation in dungeon
	overview to "you left from here"
option parsing will crash if 'playmode' option is present without a value
any item drained of enchantment was blamed on the player as far as shop
	billing was concerned, even if caused by disenchanter attack
if user supplied a specific monster name when asked to choose a monster class,
	first prefix match was picked rather than best match ("titan" yielded
	S_quadruped due to being preceded by "titanothere" in mons[])
change ing_suffix() to not double final 'w' when adding 'ing' ('t=' yielded
	"You mime throwwing something.")
using 'D' to drop when not carrying anything finished (after doing nothing)
	without giving any feedback for menustyles "full" and "partial"
"you hear a distant <musical note> squeak" might actually be nearby
differentiate symset and roguesymset option menu prompts

Elbereth must now be on a square by itself to function
Elbereth now erodes based on attacks by the player, not monsters scared
novels are made of paper, not gold
movement speeds are made less predictable by using random rounding, rather
	than via adding a random offset
some death by the-poison-was-deadly situations left stale non-zero HP shown
	on the status line during final disclosure
when sitting at a trap spot: You sit down. You step on a level teleporter.
	(likewise for polymorph trap, and similar issue for web)


Fixes to Post-3.6.0 Problems that Were Exposed Via git Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------
fix "object lost" panic during pickup caused by sortloot revamp
more sortloot revisions
fix inventory menu for response of '?' to getobj (more sortloot revamp fallout)
rings covered by non-cursed gloves not listed as 'R' candidates
in baalz_fixup, move any monster away from the two fake pool spots
switching farlook from xname to doname was giving away information for items
	located via object detection (quantity of detected gold)
changing doname to use "some" instead of precise quantity when an item's
	dknown flag is not set could result in blind hero getting
	"There is a some jackal corpses here.  Eat one?" and
	"You can only lift some of the some jackal corpses.  Continue?"
catch up win/Qt/qt_win.cpp on 18-Dec-2015 change to formatkiller()
fix for long lines in config file (28-Jan-2016) made 'O' command's 'list' and
	'remove' menu choices in interactive handling for menu colorings,
	message types, and autopickup exceptions subject to buffer overflow
when picking a destination for #jump, '$' to show valid dest. is more accurate
enchant armor gave "your pair of boots/gloves glow", should have been "glows"
when autopickup is overridden in a shop, always-pick-up exceptions and
	pickup_thrown still picked unpaid items up


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes
-----------------------------------------
tiles: wrinkled spellbook had a spurious brown pixel on far right edge of tile
tiles: when statues are displayed as corresponding monsters, total_tiles_used
	in generated src/tile.c had incorrect value
tty: M-N gave "Unknown command 'M-" with "'." finishing the sentence on the
	line below it, leaving bogus '.' displayed on the top row of the map
tty: specifying all four of role, race, gender, and alignment still prompted
	for confirmation with "Is this ok?" before starting play
tty: responding with <return> or <enter> during role, race, &c selection
	behaved same as <escape> to quit; now it will pick [random] instead
tty: rename struct variable 'filter' (role.c) and function 'winch()' (wintty.c)
	to avoid conflicts with <curses.h>
tty: skip selector letter and selection indicator (-,+,#) during menu coloring
tty: '>' no longer closes a menu window
tty: if color is disabled and use_inverse is enabled, display lava in inverse
	video so that it is visually distinguishable from water
tty: if "--More--" was written to leftmost column (beginning of second line)
	while hero was swallowed, cursor would end up in wrong place (at end
	of status line instead back on map) after message line was cleared
tty: long message lines which wrap when shown on the top line might be
	re-displayed incorrectly by ^P for msg_window={full,combo,reverse}
unix/X11: in top level Makefile, some commented out definitions of VARDATND
	misspelled pilemark.xbm (as pilemark.xpm)
unix: options file with CR+LF line ends and an invalid option line resulted in
	"ad option line: "whatever-the-line-was
	because embedded carriage return character changed cursor's position
unix: race condition with parallel make: src/Makefile might start building
	makedefs before finishing monst.o and objects.o; if so, util/Makefile
	can build them too, and they might be clobbered by simultaneous write
unix: Makefile.{src,utl} ignored CPPFLAGS which is expanded by the default .c
	rule by GNU make so if user had a value for that in the environment,
	it would apply to some files but not others; explicitly override it
win32gui: getversionstring() was overflowing the provided Help About buffer
win32gui: guard against buffer overflow in in mswin_getlin()
win32gui: handle menu_color attribute
MacOSX: initial binary release was built from out of date source code that
	had 'BETA' and 'DEBUG' inappropriately enabled
MacOSX: force TIMED_DELAY build option on so that 'runmode' run-time option
	is functional
Qt: could issue impossible "Destroy called before we know if Menu or Text"
	followed by crash caused by deferencing a Null pointer if player quit
	immediately after creating character and declined to disclose anything
X11: core bug for '`' (backtick) and #terrain commands was only noticed by
	X11 interface: impossible "add_menu: called before start_menu"
X11: enable a scroll bar in menu windows
X11: support pre-selected entries in menu windows
X11: make the extended command menu be easier to use and look a little nicer
X11: make the getline text entry widget display a bigger text entry area
X11: color didn't work when the map was displayed as text rather than tiles
X11: use grayscale monster tiles for statues
X11/USE_XPM: [post-3.6.0 issue] the 'tiles' bug of incorrect total_tiles_used
	for STATUES_LOOK_LIKE_MONSTERS broke XPM manipulation of tiles data
