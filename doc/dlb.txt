NAME
       dlb - NetHack data librarian

SYNOPSIS
       dlb { xct } [ vfIC ] arguments...  [ files...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Dlb  is  a file archiving tool in the spirit (and tradition) of tar for
       NetHack version 3.1 and higher.  It is used  to  maintain  the  archive
       files  from which NetHack reads special level files and other read-only
       information.  Note that like tar the command and option specifiers  are
       specified  as  a  continuous  string  and are followed by any arguments
       required in the same order as the option specifiers.

       ^?ALLDOCS This facility is optional and may be excluded during  NetHack
       configuration.   ^:  ^?DLB This facility is optional but is included in
       this NetHack configuration.  ^:  This  facility  is  optional  and  was
       excluded from this NetHack configuration.  ^.  ^.

COMMANDS
       The  x  command  causes dlb to extract the contents of the archive into
       the current directory.

       The c command causes dlb to create a new archive from files in the cur-
       rent directory.

       The t command lists the files in the archive.

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
       v           verbose output

       f archive   specify the archive.  Default if f not specified is LIBFILE
       (usually the nhdat file in the playground).

       I lfile     specify the file containing the list of files to put in  to
       or extract from the archive if no files are listed on the command line.
       Default for archive creation if no files are listed is LIBLISTFILE.

       C dir       change directory.  Changes directory before trying to  read
       any files (including the archive and the lfile).

EXAMPLES
       Create the default archive from the default file list:
                   dlb c

       List the contents of the archive 'foo':
                   dlb tf foo

BUGS
       Not  a  good  tar  emulation;  - does not mean stdin or stdout.  Should
       include an optional compression facility.  Not all read-only files  for
       NetHack can be read out of an archive; examining the source is the only
       way to know which files can be.
