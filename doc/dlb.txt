NAME
     dlb - NetHack data librarian

SYNOPSIS
     dlb { xct } [ vfIC ] arguments...  [ files... ]

DESCRIPTION
     Dlb is a file archiving tool in the spirit  (and  tradition)
     of  tar  for  NetHack version 3.1 and higher.  It is used to
     maintain the archive files from which NetHack reads  special
     level files and other read-only information.  Note that like
     tar the command and option specifiers  are  specified  as  a
     continuous string and are followed by any arguments required
     in the same order as the option specifiers.

     This facility is optional and may be excluded during NetHack
     configuration.

COMMANDS
     The x command causes dlb to  extract  the  contents  of  the
     archive into the current directory.

     The c command causes dlb to create a new archive from  files
     in the current directory.

     The t command lists the files in the archive.

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
     v           verbose output

     f archive   specify the archive.  Default if f not specified
     is LIBFILE (usually the nhdat file in the playground).

     I lfile     specify the file containing the list of files to
     put in to or extract from the archive if no files are listed
     on the command line.  Default for  archive  creation  if  no
     files are listed is LIBLISTFILE.

     C dir       change directory.  Changes directory before try-
     ing to read any files (including the archive and the lfile).

EXAMPLES
     Create the default archive from the default file list:
                 dlb c

     List the contents of the archive 'foo':
                 dlb tf foo

BUGS
     Not a good tar emulation; - does not mean stdin  or  stdout.
     Should  include  an  optional compression facility.  Not all
     read-only files for NetHack can be read out of  an  archive;
     examining the source is the only way to know which files can
     be.
