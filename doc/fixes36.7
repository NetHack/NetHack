$NHDT-Branch: NetHack-3.6 $:$NHDT-Revision: 1.21 $ $NHDT-Date: 1683746783 2023/05/10 19:26:23 $

fixes36.7 contains a summary of changes made to 3.6.6 in order to
produce 3.6.7 as well as any post-release fixes in binaries.


General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
during engraving, spaces were counted instead of non-space (cherry-pick of
	4e0a1e04 from NetHack-3.7)
avoid potential buffer overflow in append_str()
resolve missing dependency in NetHack.sln
code in include/tradstdc.h was trying to suppress warn_unused result by
	defining warn_unused_result to an empty string and that began causing
	a build error within a system-supplied header file cdefs.h when using
	ubuntu impish 21.10; disable that for any Linux unless GCC_URWARN is
	defined to force it back into effect
update_inventory() after leash goes slack
player assigned name for monsters, specific objects, or object types could be
	longer than what was intented to be allowed; for 'curses', much longer

Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes or Features
-----------------------------------------------------
windows: added winflexbison to travis-ci configuration to permit full build of
	levcomp and dgncomp
windows: a bad chdir specified in win/win32/dgnstuff.mak caused full build to
	abort
windows: the console.rc file had outdated information stating 3.6.3 when the
	official 3.6.6 binary was built.
windows: switch from using keyhandling dll's to incorporating the three 
	variations (default, ray, 340) in sys/winnt/nttty.c
curses: cherry-picked selectsaved code from 3.7 for menu of save files
NetHackW: fix delay rendering of cursor when using farlook


General New Features
--------------------
none


Fixes to 3.6.7 Post-release Problems and other Post-release changes
-------------------------------------------------------------------
extend the fix for build failure w/ newer C library headers to macOS (pr #988)
Windows: fix range error detected by address sanitizer in plselInitDialog()
hilite_pile can remain on the map after eating food off the floor
vms: update winprocs.h to ensure that CLR_MAX is defined; necessary for
	compiling vmsmail.c which uses winprocs.h but not hack.h
curses: when #quitting, just before the high scores are about to be shown
	status_window was NULL and dereferenced, so add checks (issue #1090)
unix: update Makefile.dat so that if parallel make is used, it will build
	the data files "engrave", "epitaph", and "bogusmon" sequentially;
	'makedefs -s' builds all three at once and doing parallel instances
	of that can produce seemingly mysterious problems by stomping on
	each other's results
fix the mingw32 build of NetHack 3.6.7 by updating sys/winnt/Makefile.gcc,
	sys/winnt/winnt.c and sys/winnt/stubs.c
