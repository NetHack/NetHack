.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Dlb
is a file archiving tool in the spirit (and tradition) of tar for
NetHack version 3.1 and higher.  It is used to maintain the
archive files from which NetHack reads special level files and other
read-only information.  Note that like tar the command and option
specifiers are specified as a continuous string and are followed
by any arguments required in the same order as the option specifiers.

.SH BUGS
.PP
Not a good tar emulation; - does not mean stdin or stdout.
Should include an optional compression facility.
Not all read-only files for NetHack can be read out of an archive;
examining the source is the only way to know which files can be.
