instead of setting game options or maintaining conducts,
change foocubus interactions to ask for consent
based on players response, foocubi will learn player's gender preferences
player can chat with foocubi at any time to change prefs

if player is straight or gay, no change in headache/cancellation probability
if player is bi, then foocubi are twice as likely to get headaches
if player is ace, random half of foocubi have nymph-like seduction (disrobing
  but no laying in arms), no change in headache/cancellation probability

dont' forget to update sink kicking too
double check nymph behaviour - chatting, seduction. change this too?
