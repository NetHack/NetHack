idea for new LGBTQ patch:
instead of setting game options or maintaining conducts,
change foocubus interactions to ask for consent
based on players response, foocubi will learn player's preferences

ask for consent 3 times:
-first time interacting with foocubus, learn not gay or not straight
-second consent query is the first time they encounter other type of foocubus,
learn their orientation: straight, gay, bi, or asexual
-third consent is first time they encounter a foocubus after the player changes
to the other gender, learn if orientation is relative or absolute

consent is queried using same mechanics as "shall I take off your cloak?"
maybe even use these questions that already exist in the game,
only present new consent message if no other "shall i remove..." questions are asked
use "such a nice guy, i wish" message when turned down
try to keep foocubi messages as similar as possible to vanilla

--

actually, relative/absolute is too simplistic, need to keep array of prefs for
when player is either gender

!!!!!!
new foocubi behaviour is "activated" by talking to them, then they ask if you
consent. if you do not talk to foocubi, game is exactly like vanilla and all
foocubi are straight
!!!!!

if player is straight or gay, no change in headache/cancellation probability
if player is bi, then foocubi are twice as likely to get headaches
if player is asexual, need to come up with some way preserve game balance

if player says yes, no change in outcome of encounter
if player says no, need to add new or select existing foocubi outcome

vanilla foocubi:
opposite sex will undress you, same sex will not = 50% foocubi have disrobe attack
the other 50% try to kill you

consent patch:
first encounter with either gender always has disrobe attack
based on consent, player will want disrobe attacks from 0% 50% or 100% of foocubi
need to preserve game balance so that 50% of foocubi try to kill you and 50% seduce
