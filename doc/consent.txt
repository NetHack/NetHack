# readme

instead of setting LGBTQ game options or maintaining conducts,
change foocubus interactions to ask for consent
based on players response, foocubi will learn player's gender preferences
player can chat with foocubi at any time to change prefs

if player is straight or gay, no change in headache/cancellation probability
if player is bi, then foocubi are twice as likely to get headaches
if player is ace, random half of foocubi have nymph-like seduction (disrobing
  but no laying in arms), no change in headache/cancellation probability

dish washers are created with compatible genders
nymph chatting & stealing messages based on gender preferences
