HDT-Branch: NetHack-3.7 $:$NHDT-Revision: 1.1146 $ $NHDT-Date: 1680935652 2023/04/08 06:34:12 $

General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
hero polymorphed into a vampire can use #monster to shape-shift rather than
	just do a one-shot polymorph into bat/cloud/wolf and shifted vampire
	hero can use #monster again to take on another form (randomly chosen
	among the shiftable shapes and true vampire form)
adjust bones filename buffer sizes to accommodate suffix
fix internal self-recover to work with recent fields added to checkpoint file
improvements to pronoun usage when hallucinating
function calls made from map_glyphinfo() based on dungeon level are now called
	once per level
fast hero could have random clairvoyance happen more than once on same turn
using 'Q' on wielded weapon would offer to split stack; make using 'w' on a
	quivered stack behave similarly
weight for giant spider was too low for creature of size 'large';
	weight for giant beetle was much too low for 'large'
leave some menu items out of "invert all" via '@' when their inclusion would
	degrade the usefulness of that interface feature
change crysknife from mineral to bone and worm tooth from unspecified to bone
worn meat ring shouldn't cause increased hunger; neither should fake Amulet
worn +0 ring of protection should cause increased hunger if it is the only
	source of extrinsic Protection
monster wielding Stormbringer or healer's Staff against another monster would
	heal the hero instead of the wielding monster when draining life
change twoweapon feedback from "not a weapon" to "not a suitable weapon"
don't allow twoweapon combat if either weapon is a bow, crossbow, or sling
	[later: or arrows, bolts, and missiles (darts, shuriken, boomerangs)]
drum of earthquake feedback reported various things (fountains, thrones, &c)
	falling into a chasm but they remained intact because trap creation
	had been changed to not clobber such things (so couldn't make pits)
make earthquake which hits a secret door or a secret corridor reveal it
wizard mode wishing for "Amulet of Yendor" had 50:50 chance for true Amulet
	or a cheap plastic imitation; recognize "real Amulet of Yendor" and
	"fake Amulet of Yendor" to precisely specify either of them but also
	take away the 50% chance of yielding a fake one when neither real nor
	fake is specified
unpaid globs showed weight info unconditionally outside of wizmode
walking out of tethered-to-buried-object trap condition was supposed to
	reinstate punishment but wasn't finding the buried iron ball because
	the trap condition was cleared first to indicate escape; result was
	attached chain that got dragged around but had no ball attached
when poly'd into a giant and moving onto a boulder's spot, message given was
	confused about whether autopickup would occur so could be misleading
random role selection wasn't honoring unwanted alignment(s) properly
if at the edge of the map window, trying to move farther fails but used a turn
hero can no longer wear blindfold/towel/lenses when poly'd into headless form
revamp achievement tracking for exploring Mine's End and Sokoban (by acquiring
	luckstone and bag of holding or amulet of reflection, respectively)
throttle long worm growth rate and HP accumulation
poly'd hero was able to zap wands, apply tools, and #rub objects without
	having any hands
spellcasting monster got an extra move after casting
allow defining #wizgenesis quantity in the prompt
digging through iron bars from an adjacent pit made a pit on top of the bars
give feedback if controlled level teleport attempt fails because hero is
	already on the bottom level and player tries to go even deeper
unseen pet that drowned didn't give "you have a sad feeling" message
prevent ravens from blinding other ravens: /corvus oculum corvi non eruit/
have ^X provide more information when held or swallowed
display wasn't updating immediately after toggling hilite_pet option
randomly choosing role could lead to crash via segfault
if eel bite attack caused hero to move (killed + rehumanized + crawled out
	of water), its grab attack could succeed even if no longer adjacent
specifying a count when picking [part of] a stack of scrolls of scare monster
	ignored that count and the whole stack was affected
wizmakemap didn't account for unique monsters and didn't correct monster
	birth counts
generate objects (eg. statues) with genocided or extinct monster classes
	in special levels, if requested
if the orc-town version of mine town has been loaded, creation of orc zombies
	or orc mummies would name them as part of the town raiding orc clan
when punished, involuntarily teleporting and landing within chain range of
	attached ball while encumbered worse than burdened could trigger
	"remove_object: obj not on floor" panic on hero's next move
update persistent inventory when 'menu_headings' or 'sortloot' options change
update persistent inventory when putting on a helmet causes it to auto-curse
inventory cursing caused by "this water's no good" effect when drinking from
	a fountain didn't update persistent inventory window
leashing or unleashing pets wasn't updating persistent inventory window
when the wetness of a towel in inventory changed, persistent inventory wasn't
	updated to show that
using wizard mode identify to ID 'all' updated perm_invent window but IDing
	specific items--even every one of them--did not
hold_another_object added item to inventory first, then maybe removed and
	dropped it, resulting in spurious add and remove perm_invent updates
when hold_another_object fails while hero is swallowed, drop the item into
	swallower's inventory instead of onto the floor
hold_another_object (for wishing, horn of plenty, theft while poly'd, other
	non-pickup actions giving hero another inventory item) wasn't
	reporting change in encumbrance; that would catch up on next turn but
	could be off during additional move(s) for current turn
hold_another_object used hardcoded Stressed to limit carrying instead of
	using the 'pickup_burden' option for that
transforming a potion by dipping a unicorn horn into it could result in the
	potion being dropped due to 'pickup_burden' if encumbrance was already
	over threshold before dipping but within it after removal from invent
fix priest created inside temple wall
fix vault guard occasionally encasing monsters in stone
tone down scare monster by excluding humans and uniques
lock the castle chest
revamp amnesia to forget skills instead of objects or maps
when Punished and carrying the iron ball and levitating, hurtling in the
	opposite direction of a thrown object didn't bring along the chain
recognize "kirin" as alias for "ki-rin" when asked to create a monster
make unique swallowing monsters (Juiblex) resist magical digging from inside
correctly account for fuel remaining when lit candles are attached
	to candelabrum (the previous code would make the game unwinnable if
	there were 15 or fewer turns remaining)
praying on an unaligned altar outside of Gehennom behaved like an ordinary
	prayer; make that always fail
tribute (Discworld snippets) typos, in book order rather than fix order:
	Sourcery passage #4 "the moment the words were out of your mouth" ->
	 "the moment and the words out of your mouth" where "were" didn't
	 belong and awkward phrasing because of it caused "and" to be removed
	 (would be much clearer if optional comma after "moment" was included)
	Moving Pictures passage #10 initial single quote should be double,
	 #12 "or" -> "of", #14 second instance of "megalomaniac" misspelled
	Lords and Ladies passage #5, near end add missing opening double
	 quote, passage #7 last paragraph, "to" -> "be"
	Men at Arms passage #1, italicize /for/, passage #2, insert omitted
	 word "had": 'it was /fate/ that _had_ let Edward'
	Interesting Times passage #1, italicize several words
	Feet of Clay passage #1, second "does not need" -> "doesn't even need"
	Hogfather passage #7 missing initial double quote for "Oh, just ...",
	 also #7 insert missing "you" into "Why are you feeling [...]"
	Soul Music passage #1, italicize /feel/, #8, "fossile" -> "fossil"
	Jingo passage #2 "Vines" -> "Vimes", "profferred" -> "proffered",
	 missing opening single quote on second sentence of Lord Downey's
	 line, passage #11 both in footnote:  "genious" -> "genius",
	 "was, oddly enough, was one [...]" -> "was, oddly enough, one [...]"
	The Fifth Elephant #1, italicize /always/, #9, "dublet" -> "doublet"
	The Truth #1, italicize several words
	Thief of Time #2, "gold starts" -> "gold stars"
	A Hat Full of Sky passage #9 "though" -> "thought"
	Death quotes #29, "metaphore" -> "metaphor"
	various, including Death quotes:  use two spaces to separate sentences
unicorn corpses and wraith corpses could be sacrificed even if "too old"
hero polymorphed into a hider and hiding was not unhidden when teleporting
impose tighter restraints on 'summon nasties', both for spellcasting monsters
	and post-Wizard harassment
prevent swallowing monster ending up in a solid wall if it killed vault guard
fix attached ball getting deallocated if swallowed, going down into a pit,
	and saving
level compiler creates correct novel with supplied name
for farlook, describe water in the castle moat and in Juiblex's swamp as moat
	and as swamp, respectively, rather than just as "water"
make hezrous emit poison clouds when they move
make vrocks emit a poison cloud when they flee
stepping from one type of terrain to another was triggering an unnecessary
	status update
make shriekers summon baby purple worms if purple worms would be too tough
make non-tame (baby) purple worms eat corpses off the ground
make baby purple worms attack shriekers
make hero polymorphed into baby purple worm warned against shriekers
confused scroll of light summons tame cancelled lights
potions of hallucination can give enlightenment
add a small chance of surviving food poisoning
deliberate level teleporter activation ignores magic resistance
auto-id scroll of remove curse when a known buc-state was changed
demon lords hate Demonbane
pets avoid eating shapeshifter corpses unless starving or nearly feral
blessed scroll of teleportation gives a single controlled teleport
allow opening a tin without interruption if slimed
tell player when wielding a different weapon toggles off dual-wielding
object taking erosion damage might give feedback message when out of view
	or not give such when in view, depending on stale value of 'bhitpos'
	[cited case assumed message came from drowned monster's dropped
	inventory when out-of-view ice melted]
it's possible to wish for tins of the Riders in wizard mode; eating one is
	fatal but if you're life-saved or decline to die, the game crashed
revival via undead turning of corpse carried by hero said "your <mon> corpse
	comes alive" even when revived monster was undead
prevent searching or waiting next to a hostile monster if boolean option
	safe_wait is on - override with 'm'
prevent searching or waiting if hero is slimed, stoning, strangled,
	or deadly ill if safe_wait is on - override with 'm'
allow random mimics to show up mimicing more furniture than just stairs
scatter exploding bag of holding contents instead of outright deleting them
male hero poly'd into nymph chooses charm vs seduce message based on being
	male rather than on all nymphs being female but charm message was
	using hardcoded pronouns She,her for target monster--wrong for male
	target and noticable if "<mon> finishes taking off his suit" is given
hostile monsters with a ranged attack try to stay away from melee range
allow displacing peaceful creatures
unicorn horns don't restore attribute loss anymore
when a shop is changed from food to health food, change room type to match
wish parsing of things containing monster names would accept all supported
	alternate spellings if they occurred at the end ("corpse of mumakil")
	but only some when they occurred elsewhere ("gray-elf corpse" worked,
	"mumakil corpse" yielded "does not exist") depending upon name length
couldn't wish for werecreature corpse or tin because monster name lookup
	always matched the beast form which is flagged no-corpse; switch to
	human form for "were<creature>"
wishing for werecreature figurine always made one that created the monster in
	beast form if activated; allow "human were<creature>" to explicitly
	specify werecreature's human form (for corpses and tins as well as
	figurines); override the restriction against human figurines for that
wishing for "royal jelly" yielded "lump of royal jelly" as a special case, but
	other 'of' items such as "clove of garlic", "sprig of wolfsbane", or
	"piece of cloth" didn't allow using their post-of words as shorthand
monster or object detection found semi-dead vault guard at <0,0> while
	traversing fmon list; monster detection gave misleading feedback
	(blank map instead of 'strange feeling') if there were no other
	monsters on level; likewise object detection and guard's minvent
squadprob[] in mkroom.c was defined with 5 elements but initialized only 4
	resulting in giant ants sometimes
allow nurses heal attack when wielding a non-weapon/weaptool
if riding or levitating, hero could apply bullwhip downward to pull up things
	from underwater or lava; feedback implied the item was on the surface
some monster code was checking whether pets or engulfers were eating green
	slime by checking for green slime corpse instead of glob
change light radius of stack of candles to square root
could get redundate "mon hits other-mon" messages when mon wields an artifact
failed untrap while mounted that moved hero onto the trap would leave steed
	with stale coordinates, triggering warnings if 'sanity_check' is On
when digging a pit results in it being filled by adjacent pool or lava, any
	objects at the spot weren't subjected to water or fire damage;
	also, riding hero's steed wasn't subjected to immersion either
after "double trouble", cloned Wizard would wait until he had suffered some
	damage or hero moved into direct view; keep STRAT_WAIT for original
	Wizard but avoid that for clones
beyond turn 100000, prayer timeout is longer (scaling with game length)
falling while going down stairs and dropping items due to encumbrance or
	punishment wasn't subjecting fragile ones to breakage
objects scattered by an explosion which land on water or lava weren't affected
	by the water or lava
change mkclass() to usually honor (always honor for L class) the hell-only and
	never-in-hell monster creation flags; no more achi-lich in the Castle
	(nor master lich there unless demilich gets a potion of gain level)
thieving monster could be killed while hero was removing armor, triggering
	warning "stealarm(): dead monster stealing" when taking-off finished
petrifying a long worm and then reanimating it handled tail incorrectly;
	with sanity_check On, X coordinate of head segment was reported as 0
attempting to read a novel while blind reported "you can't read the mystic
	runes" like for a spellbook; use "you can't read the words" for novel
don't let life draining reduce a monster's max HP below its level + 1
report "<Mon> expires" rather than "<Mon> dies" if polymorphed hero kills a
	non-living monster (golem, vortex) with life drain (vampire bite)
allow hero in silver-hating form to ring the silver bell but only if on/over
	the vibrating square
reading the Book of the Dead while blind is allowed; doing so gives
	"you turn the pages of the Book of the Dead" and the type of item
	becomes discovered, but the object wasn't being flagged as 'dknown'
	so if not seen yet it remained "a spellbook" in hero's inventory
reading cursed Book of the Dead while blind gave feedback for sighted hero
reading non-cursed Book of the Dead after prepping with the other tools gave
	a message referring to those as "artifacts" if either of them were
	cursed; those unique items aren't artifacts so use "relics" instead
zapping a line of boulders with striking or force bolt was updating 'couldsee'
	but deferring 'cansee', resulting in seeing the first boulder fracture
	and only hearing that happen for the others despite coming into view
the default engraving, epitaph, and bogus monster inserted by 'makedefs -s'
	(3.6.6 fix for empty source data file) lacked terminating newline, so
	when the corresponding file wasn't actually empty its first line ended
	up concatenated; default portion of the bad combined entry would be
	decrypted properly but the portion from the file's first line wouldn't
if the Wizard of Yendor fled up the stairs on level 1, the game would behave
	as if he was still in play, but he wouldn't be on migrating monsters
	list so couldn't be brought back and wouldn't appear on Plane of Earth
	(stale non-zero value for context.no_of_wizards)
if a mind flayer's psychic blast targeted a hidden monster, feedback named
	the monster but it wasn't brought out of hiding
hero poly'd into a mind flayer who used #monster to emit a psychic blast was
	able to harm mindless monsters with it
some hero attacks that should have gotten a skill bonus or penalty didn't
change internal name of "<foo> venom" to "splash of <foo> venom"
some operations that made sense to handle venom ('D', scroll of identify, no
	doubt others) ignored it because venom is suppressed from packorder;
	matters for wizard mode or for normal play that loads wizard bones
singularize "splashes" to "splash" instead of "splashe"
treat slinging gems and tossing or slinging stones at unicorns as attacks
give rot-away timer instead of revive timer to corpses of cancelled trolls
switch revive timer to rot-away timer if a troll corpse gets cancelled
uncancel an ice troll if its corpse is put into an ice box; give corpse a
	revive timer if later taken out
splitting a stack of candy bars gave new wrapper text depending upon the
	obj->o_id value assigned; keep existing text for both halves of stack
	(side-effect: separate candy bars usually won't merge anymore)
describing tin variety (deep fried, pureed, &c) relied on the 'contents known'
	flag but object identification wasn't setting obj->cknown for tins
wizard mode #wizintrinsic: setting Levitation wouldn't block Flying as
	intended because the check for that was being made too soon
chatting to the quest leader in wizard mode with sufficient experience level
	and insufficient piety, player is asked whether alignment should be
	boosted; answering 'n' resulted in being prompted a second time
end of game inventory disclosure passed an inappropriate argument to the
	inventory display routine; not noticeable for tty and curses,
	noticeable but not harmful for X11, and slightly harmful for Qt
turning into slime rendered hero as slime one turn too soon
avoid potential infinite loop if hangup occurs at ring "right or left?" prompt
randomize the turns where accessories and extrinsics affect nutrition
handle being interrupted by approaching monsters more consistently
if hero attacked a peaceful monster, some other peaceful monsters with humanoid
	shape (minotaur, zruty, perhaps others) that witnessed it but which
	shouldn't be capable of normal speech expressed their surprise audibly
make gasp/exclamation message from peaceful monsters be more verbose to
	indicate which monster is doing the gasping or exclaiming
when make was invoked with -j makedefs instances could end up running in
	parallel and could trample on each other's temp files; default to
	using mkstemp(); allow a port runtime library implementation that lacks
	mkstemp() to define HAS_NO_MKSTEMP to revert to the old behavior;
	provide a work-alike mkstemp() implementation for windows visual studio
	in mdlib.c so there is no requirement to define HAS_NO_MKSTEMP there
make piranhas faster and give them extra bite attack
fire sources can ignite candles, lamps, and potions of oil
for multiple drop ('D') with menustyle traditional or combination, if the only
	object class player picked was '$' then it operated on all classes
small monsters could seep through their shirt
don't snuff brass lantern when it's hit by water unless it is submerged
when reporting that hero can't repair a chest's broken lock with key/pick/card
	just describe the base item without BUC, user assigned name, &c since
	"You can't repair a chest's lock with an uncursed key." implicitly
	suggests that you might be able to do so with a blessed or cursed one
pre-populate teleport destination prompt with travel destination
ghosts cannot be renamed
tossed upwards objects got two times half physical damage reduction
monster xorns could pass through iron bars but not eat them; monster rock
	moles could no neither; now they can eat bars when adjacent and will
	do so if the bars are blocking their path
hero poly'd into rust monster could implicitly eat bars when adjacent by
	trying to move there, now when in rock mole form too; in xorn form
	can explicitly eat them via 'e' after moving onto their spot
monster hiding under an egg that hatched was kept hidden
restful sleep regenerates hit points
attacking non-adjacent concealed mimic by applying a polearm would make the
	hero be stuck to that mimic
hero could break a wand ("raising the wand high over your head, you break it
	in two") even if hands were welded to a two-handed weapon or to a
	one-handed weapon and also to a shield
if a monster threw a cocktrice egg at the hero but hit and petrified another
	monster, the hero would get credit/blame for killing it
since ki-rin look quite a bit like unicorns, make them be more like one:
	allow them to use their own horn to cure themselves; remove M1_ANIMAL,
	change MS_NEIGH to MS_SPELL, add MR_POISON, use horse body parts;
	they're still 'A' rather than 'u' and don't care about gems
wand/scroll of create monster or bag of tricks that makes a new monster which
	can be seen or sensed becomes discovered, but was doing so even for a
	concealed mimic seen as furniture or an object
'showscore' could be used to determine how much gold was inside a container
	whose contents were unknown
wizard mode (only way to get timed flying): if levitation and flying time out
	on same turn, player was told "You have stopped levitating and are
	now flying."; status line wasn't updated to remove stale Fly condition
throwing or kicking a shop container (that's light enough to move) made the
	hero pay for any gold inside, then didn't refund that amount if the
	container landed inside the shop
try to fix message sequencing for tame golems that "roast/rot/rust in peace"
autodescribe when moving the cursor was erroneously honoring MSGTYPE=stop
	and potentially delivering sounds
reduce the number of "seeXYZ" commands by renaming some: #seenv -> #wizseenv,
	#seegold -> #showgold, #seespells -> #showspells, #seetrap -> #showtrap
when saving while punished or game ends while punished, handling for ball and
	chain might access freed memory with unpredictable consequences
brown pudding monster hitting another monster with decay attack corroded armor
	instead of rotting it
<?> -> <full key bindings> omitted 'n' prefix and M-digit for number_pad mode,
	and ^A/re-do was suppressed due lack of obsolete '#define REDO'
add missing key binding support for rush.numpad; default is M-5 for numpad==1
	or plain 5 for numpad==2 where behavior of 5 and M-5 are swapped
allow monsters to use wand of undead turning to revive corpses on floor
	in some situations
selling a container to a shop for gold leaves any contents that the shop
	doesn't ordinarily buy and sell owned by the hero, but selling the
	container for credit resulted in the shop taking poesession of such
	contents without giving any additional credit; mark out of place
	contents 'no_charge' so that hero can reclaim them without buying
add some new demonic and angelic maledictions
when fire damage dried a wet towel, it would never reduce the wetness to 0
when water damage wet a towel, the new wetness might randomly become less
make Death revive earlier, and all the Riders after 67 turns at latest
when protection from shape changers begins, force mimic out of concealment
	even if hero can't see its location; for locations that can be seen,
	don't make double-trouble Wizard concealed as another monster--or pet
	temporarily mimicking something while eating mimic corpse--fall asleep
best possible armor class reduced from -127 to -99; worst from +127 to +99;
	charged or enchanted individual items also capped at +/- 99 (affects
	wizard mode wishing, negligible effect on normal play)
fix several inconsistencies for objects at hole locations
make repeat (^A) work when bound to some other keystroke
if a prefix key was bound to some character which ordinarily ran a regular
	command and that command wasn't bound to another key, typing the
	prefix followed by a non-movement key behaved strangely:  instead
	of reporting "invalid direction" it would run the other command
	(actually depended upon relative order of prefix's new and old key)
reqmenu (the request-a-menu prefix supported by a handful of non-movement
	commands) could be bound to some key other than 'm' but it only
	worked if the new key was also a movement prefix
when telepathically sensed pet ate a mimic corpse and temporarily took on
	a different shape, you were told that you sensed it changing into
	something but the map continued to show its true shape (telepathy
	overrides mimic hiding); give a different message in that case
when a pet ate a mimic corpse and tried to temporarily look like a sink it
	ended up looking like a throne (terrain type SINK == symbol S_throne)
have dowhatdoes ('&') catch up with '?i' to describe ^A, ESC, and movement
	prefix keystrokes correctly instead of reporting "no such command"
give barrow wights a cold touch
for configuration using external compression on save files that applied a name
	suffix, 'selectsaved' (restore via menu) couldn't handle any which had
	been manually uncompressed, mangling file name trying to remove suffix
an empty lamp hit by fire reported "the oil lamp catches fire" (but at least
	didn't light)
spells that require a target spot rather than a direction (like skilled
	fireball) would not let a blinded hero target his/her own spot, with
	feedback stating hero failed to hold location sufficiently in mind;
	when not blind, such spells left autodescribe feedback for target spot
	in the message window while the spell was being performed
prevent wish request "death wand" from matching Death monster and producing a
	random wand instead of a wand of death
grammar bit: "you hear a [AEF] note squeak in the distance" (should be "an")
during engraving, spaces were counted instead of non-spaces [later: affected
	code is gone, removed when engraving was converted into an occupation]
when an explosion scatters objects, make any that fly over sinks stop there
output message when changing fastmove mode while cursor targeting
messages when Minetown watchmen become angry could report "you see an angry
	guard approaching" even if he was invisible and hero can't see invis
when autopickup is on but disabled due to being inside a shop, have ^X say so
don't force fake player monks to always be male
it was theoretically possible to overflow an internal buffer containing
	inventory letters by carrying more than 52 separate lit candles and
	using the '(' or '*' commands
hero would be blinded and stunned by an Archon's radiance (gaze attack) even
	if the Archon was blind, but monsters would not
applying a polearm to attempt to attack a hidden monster would report "wait!
	there's a monster hidden there" and display the "remembered, unseen
	monster" glyph but only use a turn if polearm wasn't already wielded
key parsing during options processing was inconsistent between OPTIONS=foo:k
	BINDINGS=k:foo where k represents a key designation; the OPTIONS form
	recognized backslash escape sequences but not M-x meta characters,
	vice versa for BINDINGS (most noticeable for menu interaction keys
	such as menu_next_page because those can be set via either directive)
when creating a rolling boulder trap, don't place boulder on a path that
	starts on or passes over a pit/spiked pit, hole/trap door,
	teleport trap/level teleporter/magic portal
remove superfluous "All" from "All foos are already nonexistent." when blessed
	genocide tries to remove something which has already been genocided
"#dip <item> into -" produced a scrambled message:
	You mime dip <item> intoing something.
similarly, "#rub the royal jelly on -" produced
	You mime rub the royal jellying on something.
mounted hero falling out of saddle shouldn't hit ground and take damage when
	levitating or flying (if done without steed's help)
avoid "obj not free" panic if monster kills itself by reading scroll of earth
attempting to throw a partial stack of gold at self was prevented but left
	the partial stack in an extra $ inventory slot
quivering a partial stack of gold succeeded and put the partial stack in an
	extra $ inventory slot
if player managed to get multiple $ items, all but the last could be moved to
	normal letter slots via #adjust and then subsequent #adjust with a
	count could split them into even more slots
when a monster on the far side of a closed door opens it, sometimes the hero
	was told about the monster without it being displayed on the map
also show extended command name when showing what a key does in help
poly'd hero who exploded when attacking a monster didn't wake up other
	monsters in the vicinity; when attacking thin air, hero's explosion
	woke other monsters within different radius than same monster's would
troll corpse revival was inhibited by hero wielding Trollsbane; change that
	to being killed by Trollsbane instead (wielded by hero or by monster)
statues representing petrified creatures on Medusa's level might be from
	monsters who change form (golems) when hit with stoning damage
attempt to make corpse or statue of a named player character would yield that
	of a random monster instead when 'record' was empty; could result in
	statues of non-stonable creatures in cockatrice nests
homemade tin of very low nutrition corpse gave more nutrition than the corpse
magic mapping performed while engulfed or underwater would display whole map
	but then not switch back to the engulfed or underwater restricted view
#overview used hardcoded bold and inverse for highlighting; switch to the
	'menu_headings' option value so player has some control
for menustyle:full, the 'A' menu choice to auto-select everything now only
	does so if no other choices have been picked; when any have (object
	class or BUCX state or both), it auto-selects every item that matches
	those choices (so still skips the second menu) rather than every item
using travel to move one step diagonally where that step was blocked by being
	too narrow to squeeze through stopped travel instead of considering
	alternate routes to the destination
turn off input autocompletion for '#twoweapon' since simple 'X' invokes it;
	likewise for #wizdetect (^E), #wizgenesis (^G), #wizidentify (^I),
	#wizlevelport (^V), #wizmap (^F), and #wizwish (^W); probably ought
	to do so for #overview (^O) too but that one still autocompletes
if a branch has only one level (Fort Ludios), prevent creation of any level
	teleporters there (level definition doesn't have any but wizard mode
	wishing could attempt to place one)
opening/unlocking magic zapped at monster holding the hero will release hold
	(zap at engulfer already expels hero); zapping at self has same effect
when riding, allow scroll of remove curse read by hero to affect steed's saddle
the 'scores' option for final top ten display left default values in place if
	only some of the three settings were set; 'scores:own' should have
	produced '0 top/0 around/own' but ended up as '3 top/2 around/own'
allow 'scores:none' as shorthand for 'scores:0 t/0 a/!o' (player will be told
	whether new score made the list but no scores will be shown)
contents of chests, large boxes, and ice boxes are now immune to water damage
	unless the container is cursed, same as for oilskin sacks (previously,
	chests+large boxes were always immune and ice boxes always vulnerable)
applying an empty brass lantern in an attempt to light it reported "your lamp
	has run out of power"; change to "your lantern is out of power"
when swallowed or underwater, player could be told about events (such as a
	shapechanger taking on a new form) that the hero sensed but which
	were not shown on the screen; treat being swallowed or underwater as
	situations which block telepathy, extended monster detection, warning
some rolling boulder trap feedback was inconsistent
change "killed by <a foo>, while {paralyzed|frozen} by <a foo>" into
	"killed by <a foo>, while {paralyzed|frozen}" if the killer caused
	hero's helplessness
"It looks very angry" would be given if a hero wielding Excalibur or Demonbane
	offended an unseen demon lord
Entering a special room, only wake up the monsters in that room instead of
	doing a level-wide wake-up
any blessed key was behaving as if was the rogue's Master Key when unlocking
	a trapped chest or box
when an unseen non-pet picks up or uses an item, hero loses known/dknown/
	bknown/cknown/lknown memory of that item (so becomes unidentified; in
	particular, player won't be asked what to call unseen thrown potion)
wishing for a partly eaten wraith corpse yielded "partly eaten food (1) more
	nutritious than untouched food (0)"
if PREFIXES_IN_USE was defined (and VAR_PLAYGROUND forces it to be) when
	COMPRESS was also defined (external save and bones file compression
	via fork()+exec()), the file name buffer in docompress_file() wasn't
	big enough so could overflow and trigger a crash
suppress "This <foo> corpse takes {delicious|okay|terrible}" if preceded by
	"You have a bad case of stomach acid" or "Ecch - that must have been
	poisonous"
innocuous items like scrolls or eucalyptus leaves did harm when falling on
	hero's head after being thrown upward
fighter types who start out knowing all non-magic armor should not know
	cornuthaum and dunce cap
prediscovered weapons adjustmens:  only knights and samurai know polearms;
	rangers know launchers (bows), ammo (arrows), and spears regardless
	of their race/species; likewise, rogues know all daggers
if the move counter ever reaches 1000000000, end the game
knights get no metal armor penalty for clerical spells
change touch of death from instadeath to maxhp reduction and damage
report cause of death due to touch of death as "killed by the touch of death
	inflicted by <monster>" instead of just "killed by a touch of death"
report cause of death due to wand/spell/breath as "killed by <flash damage>
	zapped/cast/exhaled by <monster>" instead of just "killed by <damage>"
dying from being level-drained below level 1 killed hero without saying so
	and jumped straight to "do you want your possessions identified?"
conflict will now consider your charisma and requires line of sight
boost hit points of some golems
make anti-magic fields always drain max energy
eating magical monsters such as wizards or shamans may give a mild buzz
make exploding spheres create an actual explosion
pets are more careful about attacking monsters at low health
allow killing your quest leader to open the quest
give King Arthur Excalibur
when moving the cursor to examine the map, have '^' move to next trap even if
	that trap is displayed with some other symbol (web, vibrating square)
change valkyrie and warrior (valk quest) monsters from chaotic to lawful
change attendant (healer quest) monster from lawful to neutral
quit is not longer bound to M-q
change default value of autopickup to off and color to on
resurrected corpse of mon could end up with different gender from original mon
using a bullwhip to snatch a wielded cockatrice corpse from a monster when not
	wearing gloves and without life-saving could trigger "obj_is_local"
	panic during final cleanup
make fire-command autowield an appropriate launcher and add fireassist boolean
	option to toggle the assistance off
Angels and priests were always described as "the {Angel,priest,high priest} of
	<deity>" when first two should have been "{an Angel,a priest}..."
shopkeepers can remove pits and webs
perm_invent: when buying shop goods using itemized purchasing while persistent
	inventory window was enabled, the prices of unpaid items went away as
	soon as any item was bought (actual item-by-item purchase worked ok)
perm_invent: making an engraving which reduced known enchantment of a weapon
	or known charge count of a marker didn't update persistent inventory
change getloc fastmove keys in number_pad mode from hardcoded HJKL to the
	run/rush movement keys (meta+number)
allow using rush/run prefix key in getloc to fastmove the cursor
avoid "it" in messages "Wait!  There's an it hiding under <an object>!" (hero
	moving) and "It was hidden under <an object>!" (unseen monster moving)
don't extinguish burning objects when engulfed by a fire vortex
allow wishing for a novel via description "paperback book" (previously only
	worked when specifying "paperback spellbook")
deal with gold leaving a shop via scatter()
defer encumbrance check during polymorph to new man; newman() -> redist_attr()
	-> encumber_msg() could report change in encumbrance that immediately
	became obsolete if polyman() subsequently restored old attributes
fix heap-use-after-free when attacking monster with potion
for "a" vs "an", add ukulele and uke as exceptions for "an u<anything>"
add new extended command #retravel
remove special doinv key, functionality was equal to BIND=0:inventory
some monsters should not have been scared of bugle playing
monsters that drowned would never leave a corpse (holdover from decades ago
	when it wasn't possible to recover anything from a water location)
give alternate message if hero is blind when throne gives "your vision clears"
monster wearing an alchemy smock was only getting poison resistance from it,
	not acid resistance; give both properties, just like for hero
in wizard mode, knowing teleport away spell resulted in ^T always attempting
	the spell instead of teleporting on demand
describe a couple of isolated moat spots on Samurai quest home level as water
	rather than as moat
crawling out of water to avoid drowning didn't work as intended when trying
	to move diagonally through a tight squeeze
in wizard mode, polymorphing into hero's role monster in order to revert to
	normal form would complain about missing light source if hero was
	changing back from the form of a light-emitting monster [didn't affect
	normal play because role monsters are invalid polymorph targets there]
revise a 3.6.1 fix: if a spellbook which is being read becomes cursed, always
	stop reading: "The <book> slams shut!" and set book->bknown
concealed mimic could trigger sanity check warning "mimic concealed as an
	object despite Prot-from-shape-changers" if hidden as "strange object"
cancelled shape changer would become uncancelled if saved and restored (even
	just leaving its level and then returning)
don't include time spent suspended in background (^Z) or in shell escape (!)
	in the total elapsed time recorded to xlogfile
if a monster is starting to turn into green slime, eat the corpse, tin, or
	egg of any creature that might polymorph into a fiery monster to cure
	the slime, not just of one of a chameleon
yet another fix for display problems during restore:  if game is saved while
	hero is hallucinating but that's suppressed because of wielding
	Grayswandir, hero is riding, and the steed is on or over an object,
	restore will try to update hero's spot when making sure objects aren't
	being obfuscated by hallucination, but when displaying the hero there
	instead it would access steed pointer before that has been set up
resistances gained from worn or wielded items also protect hero's inventory
non-metallic gloves protect worn rings from shock
message "Oops!  food rations out of your grasp!" occurred due to perm_invent
	in mid-operation overwriting all of xname's/doname's obufs; fixed by
	having hold_another_object() defer perm_invent update til done with
	all its args (so fixed as a side-effect of "spurious add and remove
	perm_invent updates" above, prior to being reported as #K3401)
similar "The ogre lord yanks Cleaver from your corpses!" due to caching the
	result from makeplural(body_part(HAND)) then having a perm_invent
	update clobber that; fixed by having inventory display release the
	obuf used for each item so that the same one will be reused for the
	next item, to avoid churning through the whole pool of obufs
gas clouds are a little random in how they spread out from a point
Izchak occasionally stocks wands/scrolls/spellbooks of light
data tracking for #overview was mis-using u.urooms[] and after being in a
	situation where hero was in multiple rooms at once, visiting other
	levels might flag unvisisted rooms as having been visited
special damage attacks by the Riders and by fatal-illness inflictors such as
	Demogorgon did no damage against other monsters, only against the hero
using obj->o_id to control 'random' behavior of a helm of opposite alignment
	could potentially be controlled by player when wishing for such
obj->o_id might be set to invalid value 0 when a partly used up stack had a
	dummy copy added to a shop's bill or when a bones file was loaded
	(in theory that could happen on any system but in practice it could
	only happen on a configuration that uses 16-bit ints)
if a Rider or displacer beast swapped places with a single-segment long worm
	the segment co-located with the head wasn't moved with that head;
	if sanity_checking was enabled a warning could be triggered:
	mon (000000) at seg location is not worm (123abc)
blessed scroll of remove curse read while confused blesses or curses any
	uncursed items in inventory, but if hero was dual-wielding and the
	scroll cursed the secondary weapon, that would be dropped and further
	object traversal would process items on the floor at hero's spot
	instead of the rest of inventory
can now use m<dir> to try to move to an adjacent boulder's spot without
	pushing it; hero poly'd into a giant or a tiny creature or carrying so
	little as to be able to squeeze there will succeed, others will fail
breaching a shop wall, using locking magic to put a door there, then unlocking
	that door yielded a situation where subsequent shop damage repair
	produced invalid map data which resulted in an impossible() warning
	about "wall_angle: unknown" during map display; similar for a vault
	wall if it's the spot where the guard arrives to lead hero out
if vault guard arrives on a boulder in a breach in the vault wall when coming
	to lead the hero out, smash that boulder into rocks so that the hero
	won't try--and fail, because the guard will be in its way--to push it
when vault walls are repaired, destroy any rocks or boulders at their spots
melting ice timer could persist after the ice was gone from digging or from an
	exploding land mine
using 'F'orcefight against iron bars while wielding something breakable could
	yield erratic outcome because non-deterministic breaktest() was being
	called twice and could yield results that conflicted
have applying a polearm give feedback similar to 'F' for melee weapon when
	attacking a wall or boulder
if weight_cap() ever returned 0 (which probably can't happen), using #untrap
	to pull a monster out of a pit would trigger a divide by 0 crash
avoid "you now detect it where the vampire bat was" when a vampire shifts from
	a bat seen with infravision to an unseen fog cloud
if an artifact gets created as a random treasure drop and then deleted because
	it is too big to include with a small corpse, explicitly uncreate it
	instead of just discarding it so that it is eligible for use later
when creating random contents for a container, explicitly exclude artifacts
	(already implicitly excluded because randomly generated artifacts are
	all weapons and containers don't start with any weapons in them)
don't give lance or mattock as starting equipment when creating soldiers
fixup for the insect "legs" (some extraneous walls inside solid stone) on the
	baalz level didn't work as intended if that level was flipped
handle flipped level when fixing up the baalz level "eyes" too
prevent normal monster activity from picking up the mines' luckstone or the
	Sokoban amulet/bag before hero has done so; relying on scare monster
	and/or engraved Elbereth wasn't sufficient to guard the Sokoban prize
proceed a little further into dochat() if hero is deaf
stacks of 1 to 49 gold pieces weighed 0
the chance for #untrap to free a monster stuck in a web was very unlikely
	unless hero was poly'd into spider form; make it less hard
if #untrap monst-from-web failure happened while hero was standing on a spot
	where a new web couldn't be created (furniture, grave, magic portal),
	the expected "<monst> remains entangled" feedback wasn't delivered
if hero is wearing an amulet of magical breathing and polymorphs into a fish
	or sea monster, don't lose health for turns spent out of water
fix up some "the" handling for monsters whose type name is upper case to avoid
	"Uruk-hai is healthy for a statue", "You can't polymorph into Oracle"
controlled polymorph would turn hero into new man or woman if player asked to
	become a unique monster of the same race (so usually human) instead of
	being told that polymorphing into the specified form wasn't allowed
assigning a fruit name that matches the name of an artifact which doesn't use
	any "the" prefix could yield messages showing "the Artifact" when
	dealing with the artifact rather than fruit: "You are blasted by _the_
	Excalibur's power!"; didn't impact basic inventory formatting
selection of random engravings, epitaphs, and hallucinatory monster names had
	the same problem that rumor selection used to have:  entries which
	follow longer than average lines are most likely to be chosen and
	ones which follow shorter than average lines are least likely; use
	same workaround as for rumors:  pad the shortest lines; result isn't
	uniforn distribution but is better (tradeoff vs size; see makedefs)
make selection of random rumors, engravings, epitaphs, and hallucinatory monst
	names have uniform distribution by handling long lines specially
when filling a special room with monsters, if one that can come in groups got
	picked the group could spill to outside of the room
extend 3.6.1 fix to explicitly use name of unseen shopkeeper instead of "It"
	in various shop related messages (ones issued outside of shk.c)
fix some inconsistencies with applied bullwhip vs monster
polymorphing while wearing an amulet of strangulation from a form that wasn't
	vulnerable to one that was gave wrong message ("still constricts")
for accessibility reasons, give a message when monster teleports and
	when a monster is created during gameplay (for the cases that
	did not have their own custom message)
if a gremlin stole intrinsic 'see invisible' the map wasn't updated properly
mark some messages as urgent ("You die*.", having equipment stolen, being
	caught in a magical explosion)
if a leashed pet changed name (#name m) or an unnamed pet changed type
	(polymorph or grow-up) and perm_invent was On, persistent inventory
	display didn't get updated to show the leash's changed information
attack feedback when using a bullwhip said "swing"; change to "lash";
	use "lash" for hero hitting with wet towel too
attack feedback for monster using polearm when adjacent said "thrust"; change
	to "bash"
apply runmode delay to multiturn actions, not just running
if a giant carrying a boulder was on ice that melted, it could be killed
	twice, first by drowning, then by boulder filling the resulting pool
	when it dropped inventory before being removed from the map
allow fire-command to automatically use a polearm, if wielding it
make '$' command also count gold carried inside containers
fleeing leprechauns bury their gold after teleporting
allow #tipping container contents directly into another container
when one leg is wounded, have ^X report which (already used plural if both)
wand of probing used on steed ('z >') didn't include wounded leg(s) feedback
getting wounded in one leg when the other was already wounded miraculously
	healed old leg and kept longer of their recovery timeouts for new one
when parsing config file entry "BINDINGS=key1:cmd1,key2:cmd2,key3:cmd3" allow
	keyN to be either a naked comma or backslash+comma instead requiring
	that comma's numeric value be used to bind comma to a command
when two or more shops share a wall and hero uses Passes_walls to carry an
	unpaid item from inside a shop into the shared wall, it could yield
	impossible "unpaid_cost: object wasn't on any bill" when examining
	inventory if the shop code picked wrong shopkeeper to determine cost
when two or more shops share a wall and hero uses Passes_walls to carry an
	unpaid item through the shared wall into another shop, theft of that
	unpaid item from the first shop wasn't noticed
redo the unpaid_cost fix to handle shop items inside hero-owned container
flyers shouldn't fall on arrival when going down holes or trap doors
change movement keys and some special keys into extended commands
"WHAMMM!!!" feedback when kicking a door suggests noise so if hero is deaf an
	alternate message should be given
fix typo in message shown when hero sees a monster's wet towel become drier
for hero with slippery fingers, enlightenment reports "slippery fingers" or
	"slippery gloves" but self-probing described it as "slippery hands"
when hitting with wet towel causes it to lose some wetness, defer "your towel
	dries" until after the hit message
do some extra damage when hitting an iron golem with a wet towel
when already at level 30 and gaining another level--which doesn't increase
	level further but does add more HP and Pw--throttle the increases
don't stop running when next to a peaceful, unless it blocks the way
mindless monsters shouldn't cringe stepping on squeaky boards
falling down a hole or trapdoor will cause damage proportional to fall height
stinking gas clouds block line-of-sight
covetous monsters will teleport to downstairs or upstairs to heal
have fake player monsters use verbalize instead of pline when reacting to chat
fix mention_walls distinguishing unseen walls from solid stone
don't push unknown boulders when moving
in flush_screen, reorder the code slightly to complete the bot() and
	timebot() calls prior to the window port call to place the cursor
	on the hero
magic traps can toggle intrinsic invisibility
Death attacking a monster does drain life attack

zombies groan instead of being silent
martial arts users, sasquatches, and heroes wearing kicking boots can
	no longer miss a monster completely with a clumsy kick

imps and other creatures cussing hero wake up nearby monsters
make ravens oviparous
thrown items can get stuck in webs
engraving with Fire Brand burns the text on the floor and does not
	dull the artifact
make looting less tedious by getting rid of a y/n prompt making the command
	go directly into the loot-in-out -menu
always give a message when monster changes form via polytrap if seen
illiterate hero receiving a spellbook from their deity gets the spell shoved
	directly into their mind instead
adjust levels of sleep, confuse monster, and charm monster spells
replace monk starting sleep spell with confuse monster
chargeable rings have a chance of getting charged when hit with electricity
flint and hard gems break less often when thrown
hobbits getting a sling also get some ammo for it
elves and rangers get alignment penalty for cutting down trees
casting a forgotten spell uses some random amount of power
heroes starting with a spell have at least one level one spell, and
	have just enough power to cast it
huge monsters get easily out of pits
give a message when a trapped monster frees itself from some trap
change kitchen sink glyph to a white {
killed wood golem has a chance to also drop small shields, clubs,
	elven spears, and boomerangs
discovering an object on first turn with persistent inventory enabled might
	not update inventory info for that item (autopickup a blank scroll
	or spellbook and read it as first action; it becomes discovered but
	will still be shown as if undiscovered until next inventory update)
most traps now require touching the floor to trigger
if a lit potion of oil on the floor was launched by an explosion and it hit
	and killed the hero via missile damage rather than its own explosion,
	it could trigger an "obj_is_local" panic when end of game cleanup
	tried to extinguish it as a light source
place_object() validated coordinates after using them to index level.objects
killed rope golem may drop leashes and bullwhips
using magic portals stuns hero for a few turns
using level teleporters confuses hero without teleport control for a few turns
clear obj->bypass for buried objects [a giant on ice triggers a fire trap,
	inventory is subjected to burning and surviving objects have their
	bypass bit set, giant is killed by fire trap and drops a boulder and
	other inventory, ice is melted, boulder plugs resulting pool burying
	rest of giant's dropped inventory, subsequent sanity checks report
	that there are buried objects which are 'flagged bypass']
only give Sunsword or Demonbane as starting gear to lawful Angels
for #knownclass with menustyle=Tradtional, allow player to ask for `a even if
	no artifacts have been discovered yet, same as `<any-object-class>;
	likewise for `u to ask to see unique items
reduce eucalyptus leaf nutrition to 1
life-saving might increase max HP; if level drain triggers that, don't let max
	HP go up because it confuses healing for monster wielding Stormbringer
HP recovery and/or max HP boost from eating royal jelly didn't perform a
	status update to show the change
if poly'd hero is hiding under food and eats or #offers that food, stop hiding
hide-under monsters who can be turned to stone aren't able to hide under a
	cockatrice corpse unless there is something else present but make sure
	that the other items aren't all more cockatrice corpses
don't stop travel when going past a closed door (eg. when traveling along
	a room wall)
some monster corpses can now convey temporary acid or stoning resistance
fix travel getting stuck oscillating between two locations
kicking a trapped chest and getting the exploding chest result destroyed items
	at the hero's location rather than the chest's location; because of
	that it left the exploded chest intact
it was possible to destroy a Rider corpse with an exploding chest
when teleporting, don't consider pits/spiked pits/trap doors/holes as unsafe
	destination locations if hero is levitating or flying
try to avoid locations with engraved Elbereth or scare monster scroll when
	creating new monsters or picking teleport destinations for monsters
	who are susceptible to those
be more flexible when wishing checks for artifact name matches; now allows
	"firebrand" or "fire-brand" to yield "Fire Brand"
exclude unique monsters from pacification when untrapped from web
ask to kick a door open, if it's locked and you don't have unlocking tool
give a message when stinking cloud is created on top of hero
when being life-saved prevents the hero from moving again during current turn,
	avoid logfile annotation "while helpless" if hero dies a second time
if drinking from a fountain randomly gave the 'detect monsters' effect but
	there were no monsters on the level then there was no feedback
object detection always showed a mimic imitating a statue as a tengu even if
	it had information available about some other type of monster
avoid "the Lord Surtur's corpse glows iridescently" when shk_your() or the()
	is applied to the corpse of unique monster with a personal name
restoring while attached ball or chain is on floor in a breach of a shop wall
	could have it be moved out of wall gap as that gets repaired, then
	might trigger an impossible about being positioned too far from hero
don't try to catch up for lost time for shop damage repair in restdamage()
	called from getlev(); let normal shopkeeper movement take care of it
shop wall repair that was delayed because the hero or a monster was an
	obstacle in the gap at repair time might not be displayed as wall
	once the obstacle moved and the repair eventually took place
putting objects into a container with menustyle=traditional and then taking
	them back out with #tip would result in complaints about obj bypass
	bit being set if sanity_check was On
when drinking or dipping, allow the 'm' prefix to be used to skip asking
	about fountains and pools
calling real or fake Amulet something could give away information about them
throwing gold while inside a purple worm would yield "The gold disappears
	in the the purple worm's entrails." (note doubled "the")
inventory #adjust for !fixinv, after picking 'from' slot the prompt for 'to'
	slot was supposed to include the next letter beyond those in use as
	a candidate for destination but an off by 1 error only showed a-x
	where x is last letter used (despite that, y could still be picked)
with two-weapon combat or Cleaver attacking multiple targets, hero kept going
	with next attack after being paralyzed by passive counter-attack
trap detection could falsely find trapped secret doors; those can't be trapped
	due to details of how they use overlaid fields in the rm structure
for force-fight against edge of level, report "you harmlessly attack unknown
	obstacle" rather than "you have moved as far <direction> as possible"
using wizard mode ^V in endgame to return to previously visited Plane of Water
	now gets the same air bubbles back instead of a replacement set;
	likewise for clouds on Plane of Air
on tty at least, "version incompatibility for save/123xyzzy" was invisible:
	a blank message of appropriate length followed by --More--
fix a pair of off-by-one bugs when doling out initial characteristics points,
	resulting in an unintentional bias toward Str and away from Cha;
	negligible effect on individual games but had a minor cumulative
	effect across a large set of games
using a marker to write "novel" or "paperback book" on a known blank spellbook
	was producing a randomly chosen Pratchett novel; make it fail instead
when a monster killed a pudding and it left a glob, that glob might not be
	displayed on the map (wasn't an issue for killed-by-hero case)
if player gave a subset count when removing an item from a container, then got
	the pickup_burden prompt and declined to continue, the item remained
	split rather be recombined, making it possible to create multiple
	stacks of gold inside a container
two-handed weapon message stated "welds to monster's hand" instead of
	"welds to monster's hands"
when formatting an object, avoid capitalization of "The" in "<item> named
	The <quest-artifact>"
be less specific when cause of death is "handling a <ring or wand>" that
	happened to be silver for current game; list it as "a silver ring" or
	"a silver wand" rather than "ring of searching" or "wand of locking"
adjust the row placement of copyright and early startup messages so that
	aren't partially overwritten by prompts that follow
ball and chain could be accessed after having been freed if bones were saved
early post-3.4.3 tried to fix the "naming artifacts trick" which could be used
	to distinguish the type of some undiscovered items, but using a name
	that only matched an artifact after capitalization was exploitable
the u.ustuck hierarchy is:  swallowed by ustuck, hero poly'd into sticky form
	is holding ustuck even if ustuck is sticky, ustuck is holding hero;
	but some code assumed that the first two cases were reversed and
	could make formerly sticky pold'd hero clear ustuck, leaving hero
	swallowed by nothing (u.uswallow==1 with u.ustuck==NULL); that could
	cause a crash if u.ustuck got dereferenced
when a vampire gains levels and grows into a vampire lord, change its cham
	field (shapechanger base type) from vampire to vampire lord so that if
	it revives in base form it won't revert to plain vampire
a migrating long worm that couldn't arrive could be placed at <0,0> while
	setting up another migration attempt to the level, triggering
        impossible "trying to place long worm tail at <0,0> mstate:8 on level"
	(message is confused; it should say "long worm" without tail)
dropping things with 'D' wouldn't merge them with compatible items already at
	that floor spot because use of obj->bypass made them seem incompatible
a hero on the quest home level who runs or travels past the quest leader and
	gets tossed out of the quest for some reason would keep running on the
	far side of the quest portal
allow rush/run over water if wearing discovered water walking boots
flying pets wouldn't target underwater food but if they happened to fly over
	such food they could and would eat it
praying on an altar with pet corpse on it can revive the pet
applying a cursed oil lamp can make your hands slippery
valkyries start with a spear instead of a long sword
grid bugs don't have hands
if #wizmakemap was used to generate a replacement level while any shopkeeper,
	temple priest, or vault guard from the level was off of it at the
	time, the monster's eshk, epri, or egd data became invalid and would
	cause trouble if the monster returned to its 'home' level
similarly, if #wizfliplevel was used to transpose an active level while a
	vauld guard was maintaining a temporary corridor or while a monster
	with eshk, epri, or egd data was off level, that data became invalid
blessed potion of polymorph will prompt user for monster to poly into
out of array bounds access attempt occurred when deciding whether to bounce
	if wand or spell zap reached edge of map
if blind hero was challanged by a vault guard, it wasn't possible to see how
	to start following that guard out of the vault
make taming via magic harp be consistent with scroll of taming and charm
	spell:  an angry shopkeeper becomes pacified (but never tamed)
wielding a bec de corbin makes ravens generate peaceful
moving with 'm' prefix allows hero to enter a known pit carefully
rangers always succeed in disarming bear traps, unless impaired
bigroom variant 2 may have ice floor in unlit areas
bigroom variant 4 may have two large squares of terrain in the middle
bigroom variant 5 may have patches of ice or clouds
some large monsters can knock back smaller monsters with a hit

chances of random item being an artifact depends on already existing artifacts
monsters can zap wands of teleportation at hero
piranhas devour corpses
turn on menucolors boolean automatically if any menucolors are defined

more consistent feedback if a reviving corpse becomes an unseen monster
improve consistency between applying a key and explicitly opening a door:
	if in a pit, you're told "you can't" and no time elapses; if there
	isn't any door in the direction supplied, you're told "no door" and
	time elapses if you discover the non-door's terrain type but doesn't
	if you already knew the type there
if a bones file contains a doppelganger imitating a unique monster, a game
	that loads those bones will end up with that monster counted as
	having already been created so it won't be created if/when the time
	for that arrives (the doppelganger will change its shape normally,
	not be stuck in the unique monster's form)
when mounted hero got hit by an explosion, hero and steed shared resistances

	"you wipe out the message that was written in the _dust_"
orc hero starts with poison resistance but orc monsters lacked that

hero with exceptional strength (18/01..18/100) retained that when polymorphed
	into any monster lacking the strongmonst attribute
give hero poly'd into a giant 19 strength instead of 18/100
wait for a response after displaying wishing help; affects X11
guardian nagas' constriction attack could never hit because the two preceding

don't allow monsters to disarm hero with bullwhip if hero is engulfed
teleporting an object out of a shop put it on the shop bill instead of dealing
	with robbery
map browsing during gold detection didn't describe fake gold marking traps

if hero's action caused engulfer to expel swallowed hero, it might do so onto
	a level teleporter and then have its memory accessed after being
	freed when current level was saved in order to load destination level
throwing recoil while levitating could send hero out of shop while carrying
	unpaid items, triggering sanity check warnings; once outside, taking
	a step other than back into the shop was treated as a robbery
if punished and iron ball was cursed and wielded--so welded to hand--falling

prevent paralyzed hero from helping nymph or succubus remove worn armor
when identifying items via menu and more than one pass is needed (so when
	identifying 3 items and player only picks 1, for instance), issue
	--More-- because the next menu might cover up the ID message(s)
slightly more interesting Gehennom filler levels

	malloc implementation which overwrites the contents of freed memory
ensure that all window interfaces respect flags.silent (suppress terminal beep)
falling into lava, being life-saved, and teleporting out could yield redundant
	descriptions of what was present at hero's new location
if hero had passes-walls capability and was at the location of a closed door,
	attempting to use 'o' on own spot reported "you don't find anything
	here to loot"; change to open door for '.' (or '<'), only loot for '>'
items thrown by monster landing on an altar did not show BUC flash


Fixes to 3.7.0-x General Problems Exposed Via git Repository
------------------------------------------------------------
incrementing EDITLEVEL to invalidate incompatible save files was not working
	as intended because VERSION_COMPABILITY was defined as 3.7.0-0 and up
	rather than as 3.7.0-N for the current EDITLEVEL 'N'; undefine it
fix compile when DLB isn't defined
urealtime.realtime was being incorrectly calculated
revised "mysterious force" when climbing out of gehennom could generate
	warnings about "rn2(0) attempted" or "rn2(-n) attempted"
after 'w' on split stack patch, wielding '-' would cause an object_lost panic
same patch allowed partial stack from getobj to replace cursed wielded weapon
autounlock of door or chest took no time; chest case depended on whether
	anything got looted along with the unlocking
autounlock with artifact unlocking tool didn't do touch check on that tool
autounlock picked Rogue's artifact key over lock-pick or credit card (or
	ordinary key depending upon invent order) even for non-rogues who
	would be blasted when touching it
wielded aklys had its "(tethered weapon...)" description scrambled
randomized trap name could pick trap #0 which isn't a trap and yielded "water"
if running and Blind or Stunned or Fumbling or Dex < 10, encountering a closed
	door orthogonally would keep reporting "ouch! you bump into a door"
	repeatedly until eventually interrupted by approaching monster or
	hunger or ^C
data.base lookup of an entry with any blank lines would falsely claim that
	"'data' file in wrong fromat or corrupted" after some extra checks
	were added while investigating tab handling anomalies
using nhl_error() to report a Lua processing problem would clobber the stack
level teleporation's "You materialize on a different level!" could be given
	out of sequence with other arrival messages
more sequencing: if wielding Sting or similar and level teleporting to a
	level with different warning effect, the start-glowing or stop-glowing
	message came before the materialize message on the destination level
prevent "you materialize on a different level" after "a mysterious force
	prevents you from descending" if you try to level teleport past the
	stairs down from the quest home level before being granted access
creating Mine Town variant 1 (Orcish Town) sometimes complained about being
	unable to place lregion type 1 and failed to have any staircase up
set g.context.botl for glove and wielding actions that could start or end
	bare-handedness in support of condtests[bl_bareh]
reinstate ranked ordering of the status condition fields
grammar for messages about a monster removing items from a container was bad
some new status conditions didn't always update when they should
fix flipping non-existent stairs and ladders (github #311)
fix door created into random wall or position opening into solid wall
handle gone portal when going back in quest
'use_inverse' option was accidentally made Windows-only; change it back to
	being more general; change its default to True
change inconsistent achievement spelling of "Mine Town" to "Minetown"
fix crash in water_damage_chain
teleport feedback "you materialize at another location" was given too soon
'mention_decore' was repeatedly reporting "you are back on bottom" when
	moving around underwater
revised 'mention_decor' was describing furniture or ice right before look-here
	described the same thing when stepping onto object(s)
poison gas clouds located over known but unlit pools were visible as known
	clouds but steam clouds in that situation were not
after the wish parsing change, wishing for "<something of monster>" or for
	"<monster something>" worked as intended but wishing for "<monster>"
	(where <monster> used the canonical spelling) triggered a crash
fix new "objects[0] class #1 not in order!" panic if plain 'char' is unsigned
only generate shop items on solid floor squares
avoid gcc 10 warning by removing duplicate definition of 'head_engr'
if a monster removed a corpse from an ice box, the corpse would never rot away
monster creation on quest levels could make genocided creatures
enabling wizard mode 'sanity_check' option would complain about invalid mhpmax
	value for level N monsters created with a d8 value of 1 for all N d8's
disable that extra check because gremlim HP split after cloning triggers it
some versions of tiles processing (not X11's) complained about the rename of
	"{acid,blinding} venom" to "splash of {acid,blinding} venom"
wizard mode #timeout changed to show timed Displacement in 'can be timed in
	normal play' section instead of 'timed via #wizintrinsic only' section
the fix to make worm visibility checks work as intended forced the coordinates
	of the extra tail segment co-located with the worm monster to match
	the worm instead of leaving it off the map; place_worm_tail_randomly()
	reverses the segments and can throw some away if there isn't room,
	but throwing away the extra segment removed the worm from the map
using 'O' to try to change 'symset' was a no-op; 'roguesymset' worked
change default for lit attribute in special level des.terrain directives to
	'unchanged' instead of 'unlit'
replace worm tail placement code that reportedly led to a sanity_check warning
	[no actual code problem found; might be compiler bug for 'xchar']
learn scroll of teleportation after reading even when random destination is
	right by starting spot
fix off-by-one bug in dimensions of theme rooms
fire/frost horn feedback when zapped by monster was inaccurate (falsely
	claimed that it was "directed at self" when attacking hero)
tins of spinach and 'dead' eggs could cause out of array bounds access
	attempting to index into mons[] by polyfodder() macro
options help ('? g') listed all boolean options, then repeated them among
	the compound options; on macOS they showed a description of "(null)"
	but for other sprintf implementations they might cause a crash
change name of #wizlevelflip to #wizfliplevel
dwarves could sometimes pass through walls without digging their way
fix genetic engineers dropping Schroedinger's cat box
the checks and handling for fountains, sinks, and drawbridges were being
	missed during liquid_flow
monster movement flags unification allowed displacer beasts to displace Riders
a long worm with no visible segments (but one internal segment) might trigger
	warning: tail 'segement' at <0,some_y>, worm at <mx,my> if teleported
adding displacer beast inadvertently introduced a regression in swapping with
	pets, allowing them to be pulled into water by hero on/over water
splitting #if MAIL into #if MAIL_STRUCTURES and #if MAIL made it possible to
	wish for and write scrolls of mail with MAIL disabled, but attempting
	to read such a scroll issued impossible "What weird effect is this?"
remove M2_MALE flag that was unintentionally left on dwarf lord/lady/leader
	entry and was preventing female incarnations
tilemap.c wasn't building if STATUES_LOOK_LIKE_MONSTERS wasn't defined; also,
	to match the code that should be defined so change the preprocessor
	test to 'ifndef STATUES_DONT_LOOK_LIKE_MONSTERS'
ensure that monster female name variation ends up as a female during ^G
arbitrate when there is a conflict between gender term (male or female) and
	a gender-tied monster name (cavewoman) during ^G; gender term wins
wizard mode sanity check complained about Wizard's clone mimicking a monster
new ^G gender-naming handling code required a guard against null permonst
	pointer which could occur under some circumstances
replace "aligned priest" entries in Pri-loca.lua, astral.lua, minetn-1.lua,
	and sanctum.lua, with "aligned cleric"
attempting to swap places with a peaceful monster might cause it to flee
gender-specific monster names can be used in .lua files with the gender upheld
remove unused vision tables
changes accompanying sorting of discoveries resulted in omitting very last
	item for '`'/#knownclass on a class where every item was discoverable
	and had no extra labels (so potions and rings, possibly others, but
	not scrolls or wands) and every item was actually discovered
change to can_reach_floor() resulted in hero being unable to reach the floor
	when held by a lichen
panic if lua init fails
change wizard mode command #wizmgender to wizard mode option 'wizmgender'
engraving with non-blade dulled the weapon anyway (pr #464)
'sortdiscoveries:s' had a spurious generic header shown at the start of the
	last class if there were any artifacts or unique items discovered
loss of saddle by opening magic left hero mounted on unsaddled steed
avoid segfault during error reporting for bad 'O' value(s) after theme rooms
	have been initialized, leaving iflags.in_lua set
avoid complaints of "nothing to foo" for 'force_invmenu' if there are no
	likely candidates to foo with but there are hidden acceptable choices
avoid "Not carrying anything.  Never mind." for 'force_invmenu'
'altmeta' option could be toggled On but once On could not be toggled back Off
wearing a ring of protection and any amulet behaved as if wearing an amulet of
	guarding when determining MC value
messaging for genetic engineer attacks had several problems
give genetic engineers teleport capability (as they had in slash'em); 'port
	away after polymorphing someone so that they don't just repeat that
if an invisible hero managed to convert an unaligned altar to an aligned one
	with color enabled, altar wasn't immediately redrawn with new color
repair some regressions to (a)pply introduced by "getobj refactor" patch
getobj too: allow attempting to (E)ngrave with any item in inventory
getobj refactor also allowed non-nameable items on floor to be assigned names
exploiting the bug to assign type name to glob on floor allowed wishing for
	"N assigned-glob-name" to create a glob with quantity N instead of 1
fix ^X feedback when held typo: "unseen createure" -> "unseen creature"
if a <foo> corpse was set to revive as a <foo> zombie and corpse was partly
	eaten at revival time and monster <foo> is defined as providing more
	nutrition that <foo> zombie, oeaten_stat() could give the warning
	"partly eaten food more nutritious than untouched food" when used to
	calculate zombie's hit points (depended upon how much had been eaten)
undead turning magic revived corpses flagged as no-revive if they were being
	carried but not if they were zapped while on the floor
forgetting an item's known/dknown/bknown/&c settings when picked up by unseen
	monster made it possible to trigger a latent shop bug with globs;
	avoid clearing dknown flag for globs
fix globby_bill_fixup to use shopkeeper instead of Null for glob pricing
applying a book to check readability treated novels as if they were spellbooks
#version was leaving the 'in_lua' flag set and if subsequent 'O' issued an
	error (example was an attempt to interactively set bouldersym to an
	invalid value), the error reporting routine crashed via segfault
lighting for baalz level defaulted to random and could end up being lit
when using 'O' to set menu color patterns, the reminder message that the
	boolean menucolors option needs to be set to True for them to work
	was sometimes given even when already True
stair revamp unintentionally resulted in cursed potion of levitation no longer
	causing hero to hit head on ceiling
enlightenment/disclosure when wielding two weapons with two-weap skill higher
	than secondary weapon's skill had "with" duplicated in the feedback
corpse of monster with gender specific names (king vs queen and so forth)
	was always described by the neutral name (ruler and such)
prevent obj_pmname() from calling mon_pmname(monst) when monst->data is null
	to prevent a null pointer dereference
correct the pluralization of monarch to monarchs, rather than monarches
don't allow web spun by spider to interfere with solving Soloban
fix parsing of wish adjectives (return value broken by changes accompanying
	figurine gender patch)
when picking up a thrown weapon while quiver is empty, don't put it into the
	quiver slot if it needs to be wielded for throw-and-return action
using bhitpos in flooreffects to handle erosion damage broke its original use
	of tracking wand zaps if a teleportation zap hit an object; subsequent
	zap traversal was done from object's landing spot rather than from its
	zap hit spot, resulting in scrambled wand targeting
restore previous behavior of the 'altmeta' option (only wait for a second
	character when getting a command keystroke, not other key input)
baby gold dragons weren't able to grow into adult gold dragons
when hero is displaced, make monsters who try to stay out of direct line do so
	with spot where they think the hero is rather than where he really is
if hero died while wearing gold dragon scales/mail and left bones, they would
	still be emitting light without being worn when bones got loaded
if an invisible monster put on or took off armor while out of hero's sight
	spurious message "Suddenly you cannot see it" would be given
an item thrown or dropped while swallowed was treated as being picked up by an
	unseen monster so object fields {known, dknown, bknown} got cleared
segfault if gremlin fled weaponless hero wearing gold dragon scales/mail
'disambiguate WHACK' patch affected field layout of objects[] but EDITLEVEL
	wasn't incremented, allowing incompatable save files to be restored
restore the boulder exception for piletops that had been unintentionally
	removed during the expanded-glyphs changes
misaligned potion colors due to lack of reset_glyphmap() following obj shuffle;
	this issue only impacted a new game
closed doors were described as "horizontal closed door" or "vertical closed
	door" instead of just "closed door"
glob shrinkage while hero was away from glob's level wasn't handled properly
unpaid shop-owned glob that shrank to nothing had weight 0 which triggered
	onbill warnings when 'sanity_check' was On; for 'Ix' and itemized
	billing, the empty weight was shown to player if 'wizweight' was On
if 'showrace' was On and invisible hero couldn't see invisible so didn't see
	self, the color of wharever could be seen underneath changed to white
in wizard mode, a poly'd priest/priestess attempting to polymorph into priest
	or priestess in order to rehumanize became a new man or woman instead
	because "priest" matched "aligned cleric" rather than the role monster
if a glob which has just shrunk away to nothing was wielded or quivered,
	unwield it before destroying it
after changes to gender tracking for corpses and statues, when a unique
	monster got turned into a statue if was erroneouly flagged as female
	rather than 'historic'
changing engraving to an occupation resulted in not dulling a weapon used to
	engrave a single character
a change to wounded legs handling resulted in not recovering lost dexterity
	or receiving the "leg(s) feel better" message if wound time expired
	rather than having legs be explicitly healed
turning movement into commands broke the rest_on_space option; it also
	interfered with using pick-axe plus autodig in downward direction
cursed scroll of light had special message when wielding Sunsword that didn't
	work for wearing gold dragon scales/mail
giving a prefix keystroke other than 'm' prior to a command that doesn't use
	prefixes was siliently ignored instead of being rejected
prior revision broke all prefix usage
movement command revamp broke 'm>' and 'm<' on stairs to avoid auto-pickup at
	the destination
when trapeffect_selector() returns 2 to caller mintrap(), meant to signify
	that the monster was killed in the trap, ensure that mintrap()
	returns that value too
have com_pager() check for failed nhl_init(); probably can't actually happen
	because the program would never get that far if lua init was failing
rearranging first-kill and first-hit gamelog messages to get hit before kill
	ordering resulted in "hit with a wielded weapon for first time" being
	given twice if that hit was delivered via applied polearm or via a
	joust hit
rearranging the feedback for first-kill and first-hit introduced a bug by
	not verifying that the wielded item used to hit was a weapon, giving
	erroneous event feedback and potentially giving it over and over for
	other non-weapon hits for as long as never-hit conduct stayed unbroken
counting "just picked up" items when deciding what pseudo-classes should be
	included for the 'I' command's object class prompt was operating on
	an uninitialized varaible
changes to stair internals resulted in summoned Kops blockcading the stairs up
	rather than intended stairs down
dumplog's list of "major events" showed all logged events, not just major ones
pickup via menu ignored player-specified count when picking up gold
changes in encumbrance sometimes went unreported, leaving stale status line
	info until hero's next move
taking off yellow dragon scales/mail or having temporary stoning resistance
	time out while wielding a cockatrice corpse without gloves left that
	corpse safely wielded instead of petrifying the hero
special level loading wasn't honoring gender specified in lua code
add '#tip' for containers to context-sensitive invent handling
sequencing confusion: picking an item when viewing inventory and picking an
	action to do with it caused the inventory command to use time, then
	on next turn the action was performed without taking any time
program would access freed memory if charging caused a ring to explode
arriving on Valkyrie quest final level could produce impossible warning
	"mkstairs: placing stairs up on molten lava at <68,13>"
if the repeat command was used after prefix+command, only the command part got
	repeated
the change for repeat after prefix+command would result in a crash if repeat
	was attempted after an unassigned key
items obtained via wishing while blind were erroneously being marked as 'seen
	up close' so behaving differently from items picked up off the floor
corpses of neuter monsters had random chance to be flagged as female so would
	only stack with others that made the same random choice
one-shot food testing ability conferred by blessed scroll of food detection
	didn't warn about globs of green slime because the relevant code was
	only executed for corpses, eggs, and tins, not for globs
worn ring of slow digestion blocks per-turn hunger but not the hunger caused
	by wearing it; white dragon scales/mail was blocking per-turn hunger
	and didn't cause any hunger itself; change to treat it like the ring
if the progarm was built with EXTRA_SANITY_CHECKS enabled, changing levels
	while riding would give impossible warning "no monster to remove"
the change to protect Rider corpses from being destroyed by exploding chests
	inadvertently prevented them from being used up when Riders revived
force-fight against furniture covered by an object described the attack as
	missing an unknown obstacle
using #wizmakemap on Plane of Water added a new set of air bubbles each time
	it was run and eventually replaced just about all the water; likewise
	with clouds on Plane of Air
avoid new "where are we?" panic if player quits during character selection
add Untrap as a potential 'autounlock' action
if a zombie revived near the hero, a busy hero would keep doing whatever
	action was in progress instead of stopping because the zombify didn't
	walk across the threshold from no-threat to threat
revised monster teleportation message handling caused magic whistle to be
	changed to not operate on pets that were already adjacent; change back
revised monster teleportation message handling could produce duplicate message
	when shopkeeper who left shop got returned to it
revised magic whistle produced message sequencing issues when summoned pet
	arrived on a trap, particularly if killed or sent away or shape changed
recent changes in removing a dead monster from the map didn't update screen
	to show objects it dropped; they were present, just not displayed
further changes resulted in dead monsters' corpses be placed at <0,0>;
	reverse the part(s) that cleared stale monst->mx,my
adding name/rename choice to #therecmdmenu caused it to crash when picking an
	adjacent unnamed, untame monster
for menustyle:Full, fix the combination of 'A' auto-pick all plus 'P' just
	picked up to limit what "all" means
for menustyle:Traditional, fix 'P' for just picked up items in inventory when
	filtering what items to put into a container
restrict stunning effect to is_xport trap types
lua's garbage collection didn't like the way nethack was trying to use it and
	issued a pair of warnings each time the relevant code got run
items flagged as just-picked-up were unflagged if you stepped on other items
	without picking anything up
activating a magic portal still gave "you feel dizzy for a moment, but the
	sensation passes" after portal traversal was changed to make the hero
	be stunned for a few turns
after the fix for zombie reviving near hero (which now interrupts hero's
	occupation), could get "revive panic" when eating a troll corpse if
	it revived on the same turn that eating the corpse would finish
a wizard's starting equipment was supposed to include a random spellbook of
	spell level 1 through 3 but it was being foced to be level 1
earlier fix for prices of unpaid objects going away in persistent inventory
	display when hero bought something during itemized billing didn't work
	if paying for a used-up shop item--prices of any unpaid items vanished
	when inventory got updated to reflect transfer of hero's gold to shk
save files created with SCORE_ON_BOTL disabled were erroneously being rejected
	if the program was rebuilt with it enabled and vice versa
avoid "It suddenly appears!" if a monster with the STRAT_APPEARMSG attribute
	is seen to teleport away then not seen at its destination
avoid boulder-on/in-water sanity_check warnings on the Plane of Water
when one monster swallowed/engulfed another and killed it, impossible
	"placing <mon> over itself ..." could be given by place_monster()
if the game crashed or the process was killed, recovering a save file ended
	up with incorrect stairway connections between levels
when using --nethackrc=file on the command line (currently only implemented
	for ports that use unixmain.c), options parsing freed the string
	containing 'file' before using it as the RC file name
using 'o'pen as a synonym for #loot of a container at the hero's location did
	not work if the hero was in a pit
update '?' menu to reflect change to 'O' command
end of game with DUMPLOG could panic due to perm_invent handling, even when
	the persistent inventory window wasn't in use
with color Off and the screen symbol for ice the same as for floor, the black
	and white ice was supposed to be rendered in inverse video but that
	got broken by the symbols and glyphs overhaul
command line processing interleaved with options file processing is complex:
	a recent change to make 'color' show up for tty in the short options
	menu resulted in 'nethack --windowtype:X11' running X11 with ascii map
	('NETHACKOPTIONS=windowtype:X11 nethack' continued to default to tiles)
when the Astral level got created, any fake player character monsters that
	were seen or sensed when created were reported as "<mon> suddenly
	appears!" rather than be treated as part of level's initial population
tipping contents of one container directly into another allowed transferring
	wands of cancellation and bags of holding or tricks that were inside
	a sack, box, or chest into a bag of holding without blowing it up
prevent random traps from being created inside the shops in the tourist quest
if hero's steed got hit by knockback effect, impossible "no monster to remove"
	would occur (plus more warnings if 'sanity_check' was On)
the #saveoptions command included options changed via doset_simple() but not
	ones changed via full doset()
fix 'nethack --scores' as alias for 'nethack -s'
adding command line 'nethack --usage' broke 'nethack -u name' (however,
	'nethack -uname' still worked for names other than "sage")
being hit by a big monster and getting knockback effect could send hero out
	of a shop (or into its "free spot") while carrying unpaid goods;
	robbery wasn't noticed until hero eventually moved to a different spot
hallucination of objects incorrectly included generic objects as candidates
	for what objects looked like; if an object had its dknown flag set,
	formatting a generic object in its place was unreliable (Null pointer
	deference prior to static analyzer fix, odd fake name "generic" after)
some actions that ask the user to pick a location allow typing '$' to show
	valid spots, accept typing a second '$' prior to moving the cursor to
	toggle the highlights off; ^R already did that; moving the cursor too
change 'm' prefix for #tip from 'use menu to pick among floor containers'
	(since that's already the default) to 'skip floor containers' so that
	context-sensitive item-action Tip directly operates on the item
anti-magic field's reduction of hero's maximum energy could result in current
	energy being one point higher than maximum


Fixes to 3.7.0-x Platform and/or Interface Problems Exposed Via git Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
curses: 'msg_window' option wasn't functional for curses unless the binary
	also included tty support
curses: line input that doesn't take place on the bottom line of the message
	window uses a canned curses routine and doesn't support ESC to kill
	partial input or to cancel; "Who are you?" prompt was willing to name
	a character "^["; have the popup version of getlin() fake the usual
	ESC handling, but player has to type <escape><return> for that to work
curses: menu headings didn't use default text color
curses: #perminv changes disabled menu_headings attribute for persistent
	inventory window headings; reinstate that
curses: messages were tagged by turn in 3.6.x so that ^P can place a separator
	between groups of messages; somehow the line of code that recorded
	the turn vanished so ^P behaved as if every message came on its own
	distinct turn, resulting in lots of "---" separators
curses: when entering a count while in a menu, cursor would jump to the spot
	on screen where the hero was, even if menu covered that part of map;
	post-3.6--started when curses was changed to use core's get_count()
curses: clipped map crashed due to uninitialized memory
curses: changes for tty's TTY_PERM_INVENT resulted in viewing inventory under
	curses while carrying only gold to crash; didn't matter if perm_invent
	was On or if TTY_PERM_INVENT was enabled
curses: for screen refresh, don't attempt to refresh windows that haven't been
	set up yet or have already been shut down
curses: for raw_print() in #if PDCURSES config, don't attempt to write to
	message window if it isn't set up yet or has already been shut down
curses: scrollbar 'framecolor' wasn't being initialized before use
	causing an asan crash because the value is used to index an array
curses: typing ESC to cancel something issued a beep; if the terminal was set
	to 'visible bell', the screen flashed; only beep when the ESC is part
	of an escape sequence--other than M-c generating ESC c--and nethack
	is expecting text rather than a command or direction
curses: with window borders on and align_status:left, restoring brought up a
	screen where the message window's border wasn't shown; once it needed
	to be scrolled to fit a new message, the border appeared
Qt: at Xp levels above 20 with 'showexp' On, the combined status field
	"Level:NN/nnnnnnnn" was too big and truncated by a char at each end
Qt: searching a text window for something that wasn't found and then searching
	for some other target could crash
Qt: changes in glyph handling in the core introduced a bug in the "paper doll"
	display for inventory subset
Qt: during role selection, icons for role and race showed giant ant tile after
	the glyph overhaul changes
Qt: resolve a use-after-free error when saving message history
tty: redraw unexplored locations as S_unexplored rather than <space> after
	map has been partially overwritten by popup menu or text display
tty: previous change resulted in remnants of previous level being shown on
	new level after level change when S_unexplored is <space>
tty: for #wizidentify, using ^I as an unseen group accelerator to pick the
	'all' choice was incorrectly checking menuitem_invert_test() and
	failing, so the 'all' choice wasn't being toggled on if user typed ^I
tty: changes to support utf8 resulted in lines of text windows being shown
	starting at their second character
tty: changes to support TTY_PERM_INVENT resulted in blank inventory menu when
	using the 'i' command while carrying only gold; didn't matter whether
	or not TTY_PERM_INVENT was enabled during build
tty: for the !DEF_PAGER configuration, redraw screen properly if attempting
	to display a file fails and tty_display_file()'s caller requests
	feedback for that situation
Unix: after lua changes to Makefiles, 'make spotless' for dat subdirectory
	left some generated data files which should have been deleted
Windows: new tile additions in win/share did not trigger the creation of a new
	NetHackW.res file
Windows: nhl_loadlua() was missing the RDBMODE argument on the [dlb_]fopen(),
	which is required on Windows to set binary mode; binary mode is
	required in order to be able to reliably navigate through a file using
	fseek(), ftell() and fread()
Windows: when VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_SEQUENCES was not defined, the preprocessing
	would fail on consoletty.c
Windows: original fix for GLYPH_UNEXPLORED background tile merging resulted
	in a new issue where the map wasn't being cleared on level changes
X11: fix build failure if STATUS_HILITES is disabled
X11: was still initializing map to 'stone' instead of 'unexplored' after they
	became separate glyphs
X11: for text map without color, add support for black&white ice; draw it in
	inverse video to distinguish from ordinary floor
X11: if perm_invent is set in NETHACKOPTIONS or config file, start with the
	persistent inventory window displayed
X11: use visctrl(response) when X11_yn_function() echoes prompt+response in
	message window
X11: when trying to lookup scrollbars in order to handle scrolling via keys,
	menu handling always ended up finding the top window
X11: enable horizontal scrollbar for persistent inventory window
X11+macOS: after the "bad Atom" fix (below), the persistent inventory window
	crept downward every time it got updated


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes
-----------------------------------------
SYSCF: treat most sysconf directives that have invalid values as warnings
	rather than errors; use a conservative default value and continue
curses: for vertical status, line up conditions in columns; usually two but
	condense to three per line if the status window isn't tall enough
	[at present, highlighting with inverse video includes trailing spaces
	used to align entries in their columns--that's a feature...]
curses: indent items in perm_invent window by one space
curses: don't change the terminal's default colors
curses: remove unnecessary special handling for dark gray
curses: sometimes entering a count during menu selection caused the menu to
	disappear (example was apply/loot in-out container menu with two or
	more digits typed followed by non-digit); in-out menu was still active
	but no longer displayed
curses: support backspace/delete when entering a count during menu selection
curses: was failing to honor menu_xxx option settings for menu interaction
curses: make extended command prompt behave more sensibly
curses: if a menu of objects contains at least one iron ball, and player is
	not already in the midst of entering a count, recognize '0' as a
	group accelerator rather than the start of a count
curses: obey timed_delay option
curses: support tty-style extended role/race/&c selection at start of new game
curses: implement mark_synch() and wait_synch()
curses: only convert arrow keys to hjkl or 4286 if nethack wants a direction
curses: conversion of arrows and other numpad-related function keys to digit
	ignored phone-layout setting (inverted up/down) of the num_pad option
curses: ensure alt+'A' through alt+'Z' and alt+'a' through alt+'z' work
	correctly with PDCURSES
curses: fix an off-by-one error when deciding whether a long line on the
	bottom line of the message window can fit ">>" (curses' "--More--")
curses: selecting a partial stack, unselecting it, and then selecting it
	normally did not reset the quantity to the whole stack
macOS: Xcode project was failing to build if the path to the NetHack source
	tree contained a space; the issue was within some shell script code
	contained within the project
msdos: add -DSTATUES_LOOK_LIKE_MONSTERS to Makefile1.cross so the VESA mode
	can display statue glyphs
Qt: quit if can't load tiles file instead of continuing and then segfaulting
Qt: [later] tiles load failure at startup now continues using an ascii map
Qt: use more columns for extended command selection dialog so that the number
	of rows needed doesn't result in some commands being unaccessible
Qt: suppress wizard mode commands from '#' handling when not in wizard mode
Qt: organize extended command selection grid by columns instead of by rows
	(first N entries down left column, next N entries down 2nd column, &c)
Qt: when selecting an extended command by typing its name, support <delete>
	(aka <rubout>) in addition to <backspace> to go back a character
Qt: switch to fixed-width font for menus
Qt: don't disable [cancel] button when viewing inventory or other pick-none
	menus; ESC works to dismiss those and [cancel] should be the same
Qt: clicking on the window's Close button brought up a dialog offering
	choices of "Save" and "Cancel"; picking Cancel sent nethack into an
	infinite loop with complaints about Qt's event loop already being
	active; change dialog: offer "Save and exit" or "Quit without saving"
	with no opportunity to try to back out of the Close operation
Qt: add 3.6 status fields Stone, Slime, Strngl, Deaf, Lev, Fly, Ride
Qt: add Attributes, Overview, and Annotate to the "Info" pull down menu
Qt: rename menu entries game->Save to game->Save-and-exit and game->Quit
	to game->Quit-without-saving
Qt: menu commands are now working; commands invoked via M-c were having that
	keystroke changed to '?', bringing up nethack's help menu; now those
	send #abc with just enough letters to disambiguate from other commands
	("Compilation" is one remaining problem; it yields "#version" which
	brings up '#' menu subset with choices of "version" and "versionshort")
Qt: "paper doll" subset of persistent inventory has undergone several changes:
	show previously missing quiver below weapon instead of duplicating
	gloves there; show secondary weapon in shield slot and blank out
	alternate weapon slot when two-weapon combat is active; show wielded
	two-handed weapon in both the shield and primary weapon slots; show
	first active light source in a previously unused slot on lower right;
	show first leash-in-use in a previously unused slot on lower left
Qt: paper doll inventory view was inconsistently updated during Hallucination
Qt: when hero died, gold on tombstone only included gold in inventory, not
	any additional gold inside carried containers; also, inventory gold
	will be zero if bones get created for all 3.6.x and for 3.4.x+GOLDOBJ
Qt: tombstone showed newly constructed date instead of the value set up at
	time of death; it only shows year but that could be wrong if player
	stared at or ignored prior --More-- for long enough on 31 December
Qt: menu choices All, None, Invert were setting, unsetting, or toggling menu
	entry checkboxes internally but didn't redraw the menu to show that
Qt: fix the F1/F2/Tab macro keys to not require that number_pad be On
Qt: unhighlight highlighted message (last one issued) after player has seen it
Qt: update message window's last message with player's response if it's a
	prompt string for a single-character of input (ynaq or invent letter)
Qt: for line input, display the prompt+response in the message window
Qt: enable the popup_dialog WC option (result is a bit flakey but usable)
Qt: 3.6 catchup - show unexplored locations as unexplored rather than as stone
Qt: tried to honor 'showexp' but the value was unintentionally suppressed by
	[lack of definition for] obsolete conditional EXP_ON_BOTL
Qt: implement --More-- prompt to support MSGTYPE=stop
Qt: for menu search, don't require clicking on the search target popup before
	typing target string (was using typed letters to make menu selections
	if player didn't click on the popup first)
Qt: rest ("Zz") button on the toolbar only worked when 'rest_on_space' was On
	(core issue, not Qt's fault)
Qt: rename toolbar button "Get" and action menu choice "Get" to "Pick up"
Qt: status icons for alignment|hunger|encumbrance which started out centered
	relative to the label text below them would shift to being left
	justified when status got updated
Qt: handle '&' properly if it occurs as part of yn_function popup dialog
Qt: fix the display side of saved game selection; character names for
	available save files are shown in a column of push buttons instead
	of each button overwriting all the ones before it
Qt: don't clobber an existing save file after choosing "new game" in the
	saved game selection widget
Qt: don't get stuck in a loop after choosing "play" while the character name
	field is empty in the character selection widget
Qt: when a new message is issued, pan the message window to its left edge if
	player panned it horizontally then didn't manually scroll it back
Qt: there was no way to enter extended command "#version" by typing; command
	name matching was waiting to disambiguate it from "#versionshort"
	and the only way to that was to type #version<return> but <return>
	explicitly triggered rejection, cancelling '#' processing; #drop vs
	"droptype, "known vs "knownclass, and #takeoff vs #takeoffall are in
	similar ambiguous situation but usually invoked via keystroke
Qt: render all text windows in fixed-width font instead of just ones which
	have one or more lines with four consecutive spaces; some data.base
	entries do have those (usually final attribution) and some don't,
	so display from one entry to another was inconsistent if default
	proportional font was ever used
Qt: while a text window was shown (such as the "things that are here" popup
	when stepping on items), typing commands had the input passed on to
	the map and then executed; sometimes that caused the not-yet-dismissed
	text window to hang
Qt: if player's run-time options specified a tiles file and it couldn't be
	loaded, Qt was falling back to x11tiles just like when the default
	can't be loaded; fallback to player's file plus explicit path instead
Qt: force the 'toptenwin' option On so that high scores display at end of game
	is shown in a text window instead of being written to stdout where it
	might not be seen (note: doesn't apply to 'nethack -s')
Qt: during role/race/&c selection, update role titles with their icons, and
	also Valk eligibility, when gender is toggled
Qt: if a menu of objects contains at least one iron ball, and player is not
	alreadly in the midst of entering a count, recognize '0' as a group
	accelerator rather than the start of a count
Qt: {maybe just Qt+macOS:} when viewing a text window ('V' to look at 'history'
	for instance), clicking on [Search], entering a search target in the
	resulting popup and clicking on [Okay] or typing <return>, the text
	window got pushed underneath the main window so seemed to go away
Qt: use idPressed signal instead of buttonPressed and mappedString instead
	of mapped for recent Qt (pr #913 by chasonr)
Qt+macOS: fix control key (fixed all except for ^V); handle ^V as a shortcut
Qt+macOS: rename menu entry "nethack->Preferences..." for invoking nethack's
	key 'O' command to "Game->Run-time options" and entry "Game->Qt settings"
	for making persistent Qt customizations to "nethack->Preferences..."
Qt+macOS: prevent game->Quit-without-saving from being hijacked for the nethack
	menu by renaming it game->_Quit-without-saving (macOS only)
Qt+macOS: add a separate nethack->Quit menu entry with different functionality;
	Command+Q invokes it
Qt+macOS: since menu entry help->"About Qt NetHack" gets hijacked and becomes
	"nethack->About nethack", add a separate help->_About_Qt_NetHack_
	which stays where intended and brings up the same information
Qt+macOS: suppress unwanted "Search [______]" action from being inserted as the
	first entry in the menubar's "Help" dropdown menu
tiles: add indicator of thonged portion to aklys tile
tty: role and race selection menus weren't filtering out potential choices
	which got excluded by OPTIONS=align:!lawful or !neutral or !chaotic
tty: '$' can now select gold in a menu even when it isn't on current page
tty: if a menu used full screen and brought up another menu that wasn't full
	screen, sometimes only a small border of background was drawn around
	it with most of the map left blank until after the menu was dismissed
tty: have <return> dismiss pick-none menus instead of acting like '>' (not
	only wouldn't dismiss when not on last page, wouldn't dismiss at all)
Unix: when user name is used as default character name, keep hyphenated value
	intact instead stripping off dash and whatever follows as if that
	specified role/race/&c (worked once upon a time; broken since 3.3.0)
Unix: add "ec2-user" to the list of user names 'sysconf' classifies as generic
Unix: work-around a build issue in ubuntu 21.10 by using ifdef to skip the
	define of warn_unused_result to empty string in tradstdc.h whenever
	__linux__ is defined during build unless GCC_URWARN is also defined
Unix: re-do command line parsing
user_sounds: move the message hook from inside individual window display ports
	to the core where it allows MSGTYP_NOSHOW msgtyp's to still trigger
	sounds to correct a reported github issue; also fixes a past reported
	issue that the curses port on Windows not working with user_sounds
Windows: update for new status condition fields
Windows: include commented-out 'PORTABLE_DEVICE_PATHS' in sysconf.template
Windows: When there was no interesting background in get_bk_glyph()
	in display.c, a default value of GLYPH_UNEXPLORED was returned to
	the caller and then passed on to the interface; the graphical
	Windows version, NetHackW.exe, was trying to use the tile mapped to
	GLYPH_UNEXPLORED as a background tile to merge with the
	foreground tile, so check for GLYPH_UNEXPLORED and bypass that
Windows: fix range error detected by address sanitizer in plselInitDialog()
X11: substantial overhaul of status display, both 'fancy' and 'tty-style'
X11: extend fancy status one-turn inverse video status-change highlighting to
	hunger, encumbrance, and conditions
X11: stop including unused column 0 in the map
X11: avoid 'bad Atom X Error' when perm_invent is enabled (seemingly window
	manager dependent)
X11: toggling 'perm_invent' off via 'O' didn't dismiss persistent inventory
	window
X11: with 'slow' resource set to False, the pop up yn_function didn't always
	resize properly when re-used
X11: (possibly X11+macOS): if persistent inventory was displayed at time of
	end-of-game prompting, prompting would stall until that window was
	manually dismissed
X11: (possibly X11+macOS): try harder to resize the getlin() prompt, if needed,
	when prompt text changes
X11: set all selectable menu lines to the same length, left justified
X11: initializing the get-extended-command widget modified memory beyond what
	it dynamically allocated
sound: add a soundlib interface that consists of a specification
	documented in doc/sound.txt; default 'nosound' soundlib implementation
	of the specification in src/sounds.c
sound: added 'macsound' soundlib implementation for use on macOS; the
	interface implementation resides in the objective C file
	sound/macsound/macsound.m; built on top of the built-in AppKit
	NSSound, #import <AppKit/AppKit.h>, linked using -framework AppKit.
sound: added 'windsound' soundlib implementation for use on Windows; the
	interface implementation resides in the file
	sound/windsound/windsound.c; built on top of the win32 api,
	header file mmsystem.h, linked with winmm.
sound: add 'qtsound' soundlib implementation for use on any platform
	with Qt; the interface implementation resides win/Qt/qt_bind.cpp;
	built on top of Qt.


General New Features
--------------------
if a killer bee encounters a lump of royal jelly and there is no queen bee on
	the level, the bee will eat the jelly and become a new queen
automatic annotation "gateway to Moloch's Sanctum" for vibrating square level
	once that square's location becomes known (found or magic mapped);
	goes away once sanctum temple is found (entered or high altar mapped)
savefile: add support to deconstruct internal data structures down into their

savefile: use little-endian format for fields where that makes a difference
replace build-time level compiler and dungeon compiler with run-time loading of

	Lua quest texts loaded at runtime
callback lua functions from core at certain game actions
some altars are displayed in different colors (for tty and curses at least)

	"secret door" when at a door or wall location), hidden corridor
	spots ("secret corridor" at a corridor location), clouds, walls,
	and (melting) ice
tiny chance for randomly created spellbooks to be Discworld novels instead
	of having only one in the first book or scroll shop created (won't

'goldX', 'implicit_uncursed', and 'mention_walls' options changed to be
	persistent across save/restore
wearing a wet towel confers "half damage from poison gas" attribute

	on or floated/flown over even when they're not covered by objects
applying royal jelly on an egg kills, revives, or changes the egg
intelligent monsters pick up and rummage through containers
toggling 'travel' option Off now only inhibits travel by mouse click, not by
	'_' command where choosing the destination provides a chance to cancel
different glyphs and symbols for stone and unexplored areas
new glyph GLYPH_NOTHING was added so !dark_room has something to be set to
	now that stone could be mapped to an entirely different symbol
added several new status conditions all of which are opt-in except
	the new cond_grab and cond_lava which are opt-out
tipping your cap might get a response
special levels can be flipped horizontally and/or vertically
new special level initialization routine, "swamp"
demon lords and princes suppress teleporting in Gehennom
for !fixinv option where inventory letters normally don't stick, try to put

	from among "true", "yes", "on", or 1 and "false", "no", "off", or 0
record number of wishes and artifact wishes in xlogfile
give feedback for '#chat' directed at walls
add 'Sokoban' conduct, tracking the number of times the special Sokoban rules
	which incur luck penalties have been violated; don't report it
	unless/until Sokoban branch has been entered
reduce verbosity when a mind flayer attacks a headless monster; when a
	tentacle-to-head attack hits but fails to accomplish anything skip
	remaining attacks (mind flayer has 3, master mind flayer has 5)
add section marker [] support to run-time config file; CHOOSE section1,section2
	followed by [section1] ... [section2] ... forced all the rest of the
	file to be part of the last section; that still works the same, but []
	can be used to terminate the last section and revert to common options
	for the remainder of the file
render the color names in the corresponding color when using the pick-a-color
	menu for adding status highlights or menu colors via 'O'
reading blessed scroll of teleportation confers one-shot teleport control
mild zombie apocalypse
list lamps and lanterns in charging prompt
let tourists read conical hats
when "?i" (show key bindings) displays commands and their keys, also show

'|' command (#perminv) for interacting with persistent inventory display
	(curses and X11 only)
menu_shift_left, menu_shift_right menu command keys; default '{' and '}'
	(curses for perm_invent only; implemented for X11 too but menus for
	it lack horizontal scroll bars so the shifts don't work there)
using 'f' while quiver is empty and 'autoquiver' is Off when wielding a
	thrown-and-return weapon will throw that weapon instead of filling
	the quiver (inspired by xNetHack)
3.6's tribute: add one new passage to Sourcery, three to Small Gods, one to

Platform- and/or Interface-Specific New Features
------------------------------------------------
user_sounds: provide an experimental mechanism for terminal-side sounds similar
	to the method used for vt_tiledata; new option vt_sounddata that also
	requires compile-time definition of TTY_SOUND_ESCCODES (also requires
	terminal-side code external to NetHack to recognize the sequence and
	act on it)
curses: implement 'selectsaved', restore via menu of saved games
curses: implement selecting menu items via mouse
curses: 'windowborders' can be set to 3 or 4 to suppress perm_invent borders
	to provide slightly more room for actual inventory info
curses: if panictrace is triggered, reset the terminal before giving backtrace
curses: if a message is marked urgent, override message suppression initiated
	by user having typed ESC at previous More>> prompt
curses: implement a dialog for the windowborders option
Qt: the "paper doll" inventory subset can be controlled via the "Qt Settings"
	dialog box ("Preferences..." on macOS)
Qt: draw a border around each tile in the paper doll inventory; when BUC is
	known for a doll item, change the border's color and thicken it
Qt: letting the mouse hover over the paper doll shows a tool tip describing
	the object--or lack of same--in the slot under the pointer
Qt: clicking on the paper doll runs the #seeall command (inventory of wielded
	and worn items plus tools [lamps, leashes] actively in use; in other
	words, same set of things whose tiles are used to populate the doll)
Qt: clicking on the status window runs the #attributes command (^X)
Qt: add a Search button to the toolbar
Qt: support the 'hitpointbar' option
Qt: add Filter, Layout, and Reset buttons to the extended command selector;
	Filter is only useful in wizard mode, allowing changing the set of
	extended commands between "all", "normal mode only", "extra wizard
	mode only"; Layout redisplays the grid of command buttons, toggling
	from down columns to across rows or vice versa; Reset puts both back
	to their default settings and clears any pending typed input
Qt: [later] augment extended command selection dialog's Filter to add a
	fourth subset, those commands which autocomplete when typed for tty,
	typically commands with no keystroke or only meta character keystroke;
	that makes Filter useful in normal mode (much shorter list of choices)
Qt: add '#' as "Extended-commands" to the 'game' dropdown menu
Qt: add tool tips to the extended command selector's buttons to show command
	descriptions
Qt: add tool tips to the icons shown in the status window
Qt: to play user sounds with volume, replace QSound with QSoundEffect; also
	restores user sound support for Qt6
tiles: male and female variations in monsters.txt; tested only with tile2bmp
	conversion utility so far; also supported by tilemap utility to
	generate tile.c
tty: use bright colors directly on supporting terminals
tty: if a message is marked urgent, override message suppression initiated
	by user having typed ESC at previous --More-- prompt
Unix: can define NOSUSPEND in config.h or src/Makefile's CFLAGS to prevent
	unixconf.h from enabling SUSPEND without need to modify unixconf.h
Unix: support --nethackrc=filename on the command line; same effect as
	NETHACKOPTIONS='@filename' but leaves NETHACKOPTIONS available for
	specifying options; --no-nethackrc is same as --nethackrc=/dev/null
Windows: implement MSGHANDLER (pr #749 by argrath)
X11: implement 'selectsaved', restore via menu of saved games
X11: echo getline prompt and response (wishes, applying names) to message
	window and dumplog message history
X11: fix map expose area, no longer leaving black bars on the map
tty and curses: support italic as text attribute

Code Cleanup and Reorganization
-------------------------------
new core file insight.c - move enlightenment and conduct from cmd.c to it,
	also move vanquished, genocided, and extinct monsters from end.c,
	and move one-line stethoscope/probing feedback from priest.c
move majority of global variables into instance_globals struct g
move zeroobj, zeromonst, zeroany into const_globals struct cg
remove STATIC_DCL, STATIC_OVL, STATIC_VAR, STATIC_PTR
old Qt moved from win/Qt to win/Qt3 and files renamed to use qt3_ prefix
more current Qt for Qt version 4 and 5 moved from win/Qt4 to win/Qt; qt4
	moniker changed to qt_
window-port-interface: add_menu() modified to take a more general itemflags
	parameter to support uses beyond just 'preselected'
window-port-interface: start_menu() modified to take a new mbehavior parameter
add some bounds checking to tabexpand (doesn't prevent the apparent compiler
	optimization bug that put homebrew macOS executable into endless loop)
unified breamm and breamu
added some stair helper functions
unified the code for finding a queen bee
unified the code for multishot class bonus code
unified the code for obtaining the inventory letter value for sortloot
unified the code for (un)locking boxes in inventory
unified the code for finding room pos for some features
unified the code for revealing hiding monsters for mvm attacks
options overhaul: moved the option definitions into include/optlist.h;
	combined the boolean and compound options into one allopt[] array;
	each option has its own individual function for setting the option,
	for retrieving the option value, and for processing the option
	following its selection in the 'O' menu, added doc/options.txt file.
function reglyph_darkroom() relocated from options.c to display.c
resurrect 'makedefs -m' to be able to derive default mons[].diffculty values
	suitable for assigning to new or changed monsters
convert obj->oextra->omid from pointer to scalar
get rid of unused obj->oextra->olong
relocated unmaintained code to outdated folder, specifically sys/amiga,
	sys/atari, sys/be, sys/mac, sys/os2, sys/wince, win/Qt3, win/gem,
	win/gnome, include/amiconf.h, include/beconf.h, include/def_os2.h,
	include/os2conf.h, include/macconf.h, include/tosconf.h,
	include/wceconf.h
removed SYSFLAGS conditional code
removed MFLOPPY conditional code
get rid of 3.6.1 workaround needed to retain compatibility with 3.6.0 bones
	files after fix for 3.3.0 through 3.6.0 bug for invalid 'bonesid'
	designation in bones of quest levels
add an additional note to mextra.h and obj.h comments that reminds people to
	appropriately init new fields if they need to initialize to something
	other than zero
rework stairs structure into a linked list
move 'restoring' to the program_state struct; add corresponding 'saving';
	both used to enforce no updating of status lines or of persistent
	inventory when the relevant activity is in progress
unify special attack damages from separate you-hit-monster, monster-hits-you,
	and monster-hits-monster into functions by damage type
unify trap effects for hero and monster stepping on the trap by trap type
replace the single permonst mname field with male, female, and gender-neutral
	names pmnames[NUM_MGENDERS] fields
adjust window port interface to pass a pointer to a glyph_info struct which
	contains the glyph itself, the ttychar, the color, the glyphflags,
	and the symset index; this affects two window port calls that get
	passed glyphs: print_glyph() and add_menu().
switch from k&r C to C99
remove the game-compile dependencies on any pre-generated header files
date.h dependency and inclusion is removed and comparable functionality is
	produced at runtime; REPRODUCIBLE_BUILD capability will need to be
	reviewed and adjusted
pm.h dependency and inclusion is removed and comparable functionality is
	produced by moving the monster definitions from monst.c into new header
	file called monsters.h, then taking advantage of the C preprocessor to
	generate appropriate enum values during compile
onames.h dependency and inclusion is removed and comparable functionality is
	produced by moving object definitions from objects.c into new header
	file called objects.h, then taking advantage of the C preprocessor to
	generate appropriate enum values during compile
artilist.h is used to generate appropriate artifact enum values by the C
	preprocessor during compile
remove requirement of object probabilities adding to 1000
delete obsolete variable 'g.monstermoves' (copperwater pull request #579)
expand glyphs to map wall styles that can vary between main, mines, gehennom,
	knox and sokoban; tile interfaces were already doing that on the fly
	by swapping several tiles in and out on those levels
expand glyphs to map altars that can vary between unaligned, chaotic,
	neutral, lawful and other; tty was already doing that on the fly
	per map cell via display code
explosion types are mapped and can vary between dark, noxious, muddy, wet,
	magical, fiery and frosty; tile interfaces already had unique tiles
	for each and tty was altering the color on the fly via per map cell
	via display code
expand glyphs to uniquely represent things that are at the top of a pile of
	objects (piletops); some window ports were already doing that on the
	fly via a glyphmap flag, but NetHack itself had no awareness beyond
	setting the glyphmap flag within the display code
expand glyphs to uniquely represent male and female variations of monsters,
	pets, ridden monsters, detected monsters and the statues of monsters;
	tile interfaces were already mapping them uniquely via a glyphmap flag
	and mapping to separate tiles within the window port code, but NetHack
	itself had very little awareness beyond setting the glyphmap flag
	within the display code
added glyph_to_body_corpsenm(glyph) and glyph_to_statue_corpsenm(glyph)
	macros to display.h for use by pager.c; the game core code is better
	off using such display macros/functions for all glyph_to_* mappings
	that are needed, rather than resorting to direct references of glyph
	offsets that could change as the set of glyphs expands or gets adjusted
map_glyphinfo() now simply references an internal array that maps each unique
	glyph to a color, a ttychar, or a tile, also to a set of glyphflags
	that confirm some unique characteristics of that glyph; the glyph
	mappings are set at game init/restore after config file processing, and
	are reset upon level change, or when some game options are adjusted
	in-game that could have an impact on the mappings, but they remain
	stable between those events
added MG_MALE glyphflag to complement the MG_FEMALE glyphflag that was there
remove obsolete roles[].femalenum and rename roles[].malenum to roles[].mnum;
	likewise for races[]
add git submodule support to the Makefiles by specifying git=1 or GIT=1 on the
	make command
add TT_NONE==0, renumber other u.utraptype values so that TT_BEARTRAP isn't 0
for Planes of Water and Air, save the air bubbles and clouds with the level
	rather than as game state; affects wizard mode ^V and #wizmakemap
switch to a flags arg on newcham() in place of the pair of boolean args
replace some old 'time_t' hackery in system.h and hacklib.c with something
	less obtrusive in unixconf.h
remove the per dungeon level door limit
remove various '#if LINT' hacks used to suppress warnings from pre-ANSI 'lint'
VMS: removed NO_VSNPRINTF conditional code
