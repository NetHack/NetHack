This fixes36.2 file is here to capture information about updates in the 3.6.x
lineage following the release of 3.6.1 in April 2018. Please note, however, 
that another 3.6.x release is not anticipated after 3.6.2, and most developer 
focus will shift to the next major release.

General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
last line of config file wasn't being heeded if it had no newline
list MSGTYPE values shows empty strings as reported in H7140
Killing Vlad while he was in bat/fog cloud/wolf form gave poorly worded
	feedback when he reverted to vampire form
spaces in hilite_status option title text field not working
numeric hilite_status values didn't allow negative numbers (needed for AC);
	change them to accept leading '-', also accept unary '+' as a no-op


Fixes to Post-3.6.1 Problems that Were Exposed Via git Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------
fix access violation when --debug:xxxx has no other args after it


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes
-----------------------------------------
windows-gui: In nethackw, there could be conflicts between menu accelerators 
	and an extra choice accelerator to fix H7132.  
windows-tty: Specify both width and height when creating font for width testing
windows-tty: To counter lag problems that were occuring with the Win32 console
	port, implement a console back buffer to reduce the number of calls
	made to  WriteConsoleOutputXXX
windows-tty: Additional changes to xputc_core() and early_raw_print() to
	manage  the cursor position correctly as that is needed to handle
	raw printing  correctly
windows-tty: Added check for when we might be running off the bottom of the 
	screen when handling msmsg()
windows-tty: Added runtime checks to keep cursor always within bounds
windows-tty: Fix memory leaks as reported in H5779
windows-tty: Use nhraykey by default if the players keyboard layout is 
	non-english as reported in H4216
windows-tty: We now support changing altkeyhandler in game
windows: Added ntassert() mechanism for Windows based port use
tty: significant optimizations for performance and per field rendering
unix: Makefile.src and Makefile.utl inadvertently relied on a 'gnu make'
	extension when using $(VERBOSEMAKE) to reduce build-time feedback;
	replace with $(QUIETCC) which operates the same but defaults to
	verbose so doesn't use '$<' for multi-prerequisite targets unless
	specifically requested; use 'make QUIETCC=1 <target>' to get the
	3.6.1 behavior back


General New Features
--------------------
integrate aklys feature introduced in 3.6.1 into display


Code Cleanup and Reorganization
