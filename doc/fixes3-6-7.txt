$NHDT-Branch: NetHack-3.7 $:$NHDT-Revision: 1.0 $ $NHDT-Date: 1676619775 2023/02/17 07:42:55 $

fixes36.7 contains a summary of changes made to 3.6.6 in order to
produce 3.6.7 as well as any post-release fixes in binaries.


General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
during engraving, spaces were counted instead of non-space (cherry-pick of
	4e0a1e04 from NetHack-3.7)
avoid potential buffer overflow in append_str()
resolve missing dependency in NetHack.sln
code in include/tradstdc.h was trying to suppress warn_unused result by
	defining warn_unused_result to an empty string and that began causing
	a build error within a system-supplied header file cdefs.h when using
	ubuntu impish 21.10; disable that for any Linux unless GCC_URWARN is
	defined to force it back into effect
update_inventory() after leash goes slack
player assigned name for monsters, specific objects, or object types could be
	longer than what was intented to be allowed; for 'curses', much longer

Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes or Features
-----------------------------------------------------
windows: added winflexbison to travis-ci configuration to permit full build of
	levcomp and dgncomp
windows: a bad chdir specified in win/win32/dgnstuff.mak caused full build to
	abort
windows: the console.rc file had outdated information stating 3.6.3 when the
	official 3.6.6 binary was built.
windows: switch from using keyhandling dll's to incorporating the three
	variations (default, ray, 340) in sys/winnt/nttty.c
curses: cherry-picked selectsaved code from 3.7 for menu of save files
NetHackW: fix delay rendering of cursor when using farlook
