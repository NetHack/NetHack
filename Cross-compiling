Cross-compiling NetHack 3.7 Last edit: October 6, 2020

The NetHack 3.7 build process differs from the build process of previous
versions in some important ways that make it possible to use a cross-compiler
running on one platform (the "host" platform of the build) to produce a binary
NetHack package that can execute on an entirely different platform.

 Part A - Cross-compiling NetHack
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  +--------------------------+
  | A1. Why cross-compile?   |
  +--------------------------+

By using cross-compilers on host platforms with fast processors, plenty of RAM
and storage resources, and an available cross-compiler, it may be possible to
keep or resurrect a working version of NetHack on platforms that are now too
constrained to carry out the build process natively on the platform any more.

Some of the constraints in carrying out a native build on the desired target
may include, but not necessarily be limited to, any of the following:

  o Access: Somebody with a working knowledge of the NetHack build process may
    not have the desired target build platform available to them. Conversly,
    somebody with a keen knowledge of the target platform, and access to it,
    may not be all that familiar with the NetHack build process.

  o Resources: Address space limitations, insufficient RAM, low amounts of disk
    storage, slow processor performance, may impede the ability to execute the
    compile process on the target platform.

  o Compilers: Some of the native compilers on historical platforms may only
    support the particular dialect of C that was popular when the platform and
    compiler were in their prime.

Another useful potential result of cross-compiling, is that it paves the way
for carrying out test and production builds of NetHack for multiple target
platforms through automated steps carried out on the host platform(s).


  +-------------------------------------+
  | A2. Building NetHack 3.6 (before)   |
  +-------------------------------------+

Very generally, the build of NetHack in past versions required the following
steps to be carried out:

    1. Compile and link util/makedefs.
    2. Run makedefs repeatedly with different command line options to produce
       several output files that are required for:
        (a) additional build steps to follow, including some header
            files: pm.h, onames.h, date.h.
        (b) creation of files, containing information required by,
            or about the game during its execution, that are stored in a
            portable, platform-independent way, that need to be inserted
            into the game package.
        (c) creation of files containing information required by, or about
            the game during its execution, that are stored in an architecture
            and/or platform and/or operating system dependent way, that need
            to be inserted into the game package (the quest text format is
            one example).
    3. Compile and link the level compiler. This step needs to execute
       work-alike tools to lex and yacc, or needs to build pre-built lex and
       yacc output (.c, .h files) that are provided in the sys/share part of
       the NetHack source code tree.
    4. Execute the level compiler to read dat/*.des files and create
       a set of binary output files that are architecture and/or operating
       system dependent on the build platform, for use by the game during
       its execution.
    5. Compile and link the dungeon compiler. Like the level compiler, this
       step needs to execute work-alike tools to lex and yacc, or needs to
       build pre-built lex and yacc output (.c, .h files) that are provided
       in the sys/share part of the NetHack source code tree.
    6. Execute the dungeon compiler to read dat/dungeon.def and create
       a set of binary output files that are architecture and/or operating
       system dependent on the build platform, for use by the game during
       its execution.
    7. Compile and link several less critical utilities such as uudecode,
       tile-generation utilities, and so forth, all of which need to execute
       on the build platform during the build process to produce output files
       for use during the game, that are reasonably portable (not architecture
       and/or operating system dependent; only the output of the utilities
       becomes part of the game package, not the executable utilities
       themselves.
    8. Compile and link the game itself.
    9. Package the game and its required files including the output from
       previous steps 2b, 2c, 4, 6, 7 and 8 above.

Steps 1, 2a, 2b, 7, and 9 above are not impediments to cross-compiling NetHack.

Steps 2c, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 above are impediments to cross-compiling NetHack.

That's because the files that those steps produce are very much tied to the
platform where the build of NetHack is being carried out. Variations between
platforms (such as 32-bit vs 64-bit, integer sizes, pointer sizes, processor
byte order, data alignment requirements, struct padding and the way bitfields
are stored) impact the portability of those data files between different
platforms and operating systems. If all those things happen to match, the files
might, just might, be usable across platforms, but the chances are against it,
and that certainly cannot be counted on.

  +------------------------------------------+
  | A3. Building NetHack 3.7 (going forward) |
  +------------------------------------------+

Again, very generally, the build of NetHack in 3.7 requires the following
steps to be carried out:

    1. Compile and link util/makedefs.
    2. Run makedefs repeatedly with different command line options to produce
       several output files that are required for:
        (a) additional build steps to follow, including some header
            files: pm.h, onames.h, date.h.
        (b) creation of files, containing information required by,
            or about the game during its execution, that are stored in a
            portable, platform-independent way, that need to be inserted
            into the game package.
    3. Compile and link several less critical utilities such as uudecode,
       tile-generation utilities, and so forth, all of which need to execute
       on the build platform during the build process to produce output files
       for use during the game, that are reasonably portable (not architecture
       and/or operating system dependent; only the output of the utilities
       becomes part of the game package, not the executable utilities
       themselves.
    4. Compile and link the game components for the TARGET; that includes
       NetHack itself, Lua, and any optional regular-expression or window port
       libraries that you plan to link into the NetHack game executable.
    5. Package the game and its required files including the output from
       previous steps 2b, 3 and 4 above.

Step 4 is now the only impediment to cross-compiling NetHack, and is resolved
by executing step 4 using a cross-compiler that runs on the build (host)
platform to produce a resulting binary for the target platform, instead of
executing the native compiler.

  +-----------------------------------------------------+
  | A4. How was the build procedure reduced to 5 steps? |
  +-----------------------------------------------------+

The following are among several design changes planned in NetHack 3.7,
and these specific changes are what altered the build process to make
cross-compiling possible:

    o  There is no creation of platform-dependent files, such as the quest
       text files, by makedefs during the build process. Instead, the quest
       text files have been converted to Lua and are inserted into the game
       package for processing by the embedded Lua during execution of NetHack.

    o  There is no build-time level compiler involved. Instead, the level
       descriptions have been converted to Lua and are inserted into the game
       package for processing by the embeded Lua during execution of NetHack.

    o  There is no build-time dungeon compiler involved. Instead, the dungeon
       description has been converted to Lua and is inserted into the game
       package for processing by the embeded Lua during execution of NetHack.

    o  Some of the build and option information that was formerly produced
       during build time by makedefs, and contained information about the
       build-platform specifically, is now produced at runtime within the
       game under a cross-compiled build. As such, it now produces information
       applicable to the target NetHack environment, not the build environment.

  +------------------------------------------------------------+
  | A5. How can I help with the cross-compiling initiative?    |
  +------------------------------------------------------------+

    o  If you have a favourite target platform (let's call it XX-Platform for
       example purposes) that you'd like to see NetHack be able to run on, do
       some research to find out if a cross-compiler exists that:
           - produces output for XX-Platform.
           - executes on a platform that you use and love (Linux, Windows,
             Mac OS X are some examples of platforms that have cross-compilers
             for other targets available)

    o  Then, make the community, devteam, and others aware that you're starting
       a cross-compile of NetHack for XX-Platform. You might need to ask some
       "starting out" questions initially, and as you get deeper into it, you
       might need to ask some tougher questions.

    o  Perhaps consider forking from NetHack on GitHub, and do the
       cross-compiler work there in your fork. Strive to get it to a point where
       it's ready to play-test on XX-Platform, or perhaps even use an emulator
       of XX-Platform if one is available. We live in a time where plenty do.

       Doing your work on a GitHub fork has the following advantages:
           - It will make it really simple to integrate your work back into
             the NetHack source tree if that's one of your goals.
           - It will make it possible and straightforward to merge upstream
             NetHack changes into your work for the XX-Platform cross-compile
             so that it stays current with the game as it evolves.
           - You may get help from others in the form of suggestions, or
             pull-requests, or offers to join the development. Chances are,
             you aren't the only person out there that would like to
             establish/resurrect/maintain NetHack on XX-Platform.

       Have fun!

    B3. What needs to be built for the TARGET?
    B4. Case sample: msdos

  +-----------------------------------------+
  | B1. Two sets of compiles and procedures |
  +-----------------------------------------+

The HOST is the platform/place that you're running the build procedures using
the native compiler/linker, and the cross-compiler/linker that runs on the HOST
to build the game for a TARGET platform.

You have to:
    1. Build mandatory utilities on the HOST.
    2. Execute the mandatory utilities to generate components that will be used
       during step 4 to build the game itself, or that will generate components
       that will become part of the TARGET game package.
    3. Build optional or enhancing utilities on the HOST, execute those
       optional or enhancing utilities on the HOST to generate components that
       will become part of the TARGET game package.
    4. Execute a supported cross-compiler to compile the rest of the game
       components like NetHack, Lua, and any optional libraries (the word
       "supported", in this sense, means a compiler that runs on your HOST
       build platform, and generates output executable files for the TARGET
       platform).

It should be mentioned that you can execute the cross-compile build approach
to generate binaries for the same platform as the host, where the HOST
compilerand the TARGET compiler are actually one and the same.


  +------------------------------------------------------+
  | B2. What needs to be built and executed on the HOST? |
  +------------------------------------------------------+

On the HOST, here are the mandatory things that have to be built.

    a) Using the HOST native compiler, build  HOST native utility makedefs

       Compile and link the following with these compiler switches:
         -DCROSSCOMPILE
       from sources: util/makedefs.c, src/mdlib.c, src/monst.c, src/objects.c

    b) Execute HOST native makedefs utility, util/makedefs, as follows:
          util/makedefs -v
          util/makedefs -o
          util/makedefs -p
          util/makedefs -z
          util/makedefs -d
          util/makedefs -r
          util/makedefs -h
          util/makedefs -s

    c) Using the HOST native compiler, build these additional utilities if your
       target platform requires components that they produce. It is important
       to note that all of the required source files need to be compiled to
       native obj files for linking into the HOST-side utility. Some of the
       source files (src/monst.c, src/objects.c) were likely already compiled
       as native HOST-side obj files in order to build the native HOST utility
       'makedefs' HOST utility above, and you don't need to compile them again
       for use in linking other HOST utilities if the HOST-native obj files
       produced from them are still around.

       NOTE: There are some source files that need to be compiled for linking
       into utilities that are needed on the HOST side, but that are also
       needed again later as TARGET obj files for linking into the TARGET
       executable, and therefore must be compiled twice.
       They include: src/drawing.c, src/objects.c, src/monst.c,
       src/alloc.c, util/panic.c. It is important to keep the compiled
       HOST-side obj files produced by the HOST native compiler distinct from
       the TARGET-side obj files produced by the cross-compiler. That can be
       accomplished either by naming the generated object files a little
       differently (perhaps with a suffix) between the HOST-side and the
       TARGET-side, or by placing the HOST-side obj files and the TARGET-side
       obj files into distinct, different directories during the build process.
       Use whatever method works best for your cross-compile effort and tools.

          util/dlb

                                 into a single nhdat or nhdat370 combined
                                 file

          util/uudecode

                                 distributed in the NetHack sources in
                                 uuencoded format, back into their
                                 original binary state
          util/tilemap

                   purpose:      produce output file src/tile.c that is
                                 required for building TARGET packages with
                                 tile support

  +--------------------------------------------+
  | B3. What needs to be built for the TARGET? |
  +--------------------------------------------+


For the TARGET side, here are the mandatory things that have to be built via
the HOST-executed cross-compiler that generates code for the TARGET platform.

Using the cross-compiler, build the following targets:

    a) NetHack sources (core is mandatory)

       With the cross-compiler and linker for the TARGET platform,
       cross-compile and link with these compiler switches:
         -DCROSSCOMPILE and -DCROSSCOMPILE_TARGET

       core sources (2019): src/allmain.c, src/alloc.c, src/apply.c,

       generated (if req'd):
                          src/tile.c

       plus your platform-specific source files that contain main, typically
       *main.c, and unix support in *unix.c, tty support in *tty.c, and other
       system support in *sys.c as well as others sources pertaining to your
       specific target platform(s).

    b) Lua (mandatory in 3.7)

          lib/lua-5.4.0/src

                   from sources: lua.c, lapi.c, lauxlib.c, lbaselib.c, lcode.c,

  | B4. Case sample: msdos  |
  +-------------------------+

Cross-compiler used:     Andrew Wu's djgpp cross-compiler
Cross-compiler url:      https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp
Cross-compiler pre-built binary downloads:
    https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp/releases/download/v3.0/
    Cross-compiler bits tested:
           https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp
       and the pre-built binary for your platform from:
           https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp/releases/download/v3.0/
       and a DOS-extender (for including in msdos packaging) from
           http://sandmann.dotster.com/cwsdpmi/csdpmi7b.zip
       and pdcurses from:
           https://github.com/wmcbrine/PDCurses.git

    - A shell script to download that djgpp cross-compiler and associated
      pieces for either linux or macOS is available:

           sh sys/msdos/fetch-cross-compiler.sh

    That script won't install anything, it just does file fetches and stores
    them in subfolders of lib. The linux.2020 and macOS.2020 hints files are
    configured to find the cross-compiler there if you add
        CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1
    on your make command line.

    Note: Both the fetch-cross-compiler.sh script and and the msdos
    cross-compile and package procedures require unzip and zip to be available
    on your host build system.

    On your linux host:

        cd sys/unix ; sh setup.sh hints/linux.2020 ; cd ../..
        make fetch-lua

    On your macOS host:

        cd sys/unix ; sh setup.sh hints/macOS.2020 ; cd ../..
        make fetch-lua

    The MSDOS cross-compile can then be carried out by specifying
    CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 on the make command line:

        make CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 all
        make CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 package

    You can explicitly include tty and curses support if desired. The default
    you'll end up with is a tty-only cross-compile build:

        make WANT_WIN_TTY=1 WANT_WIN_CURSES=1 CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 all
        make WANT_WIN_TTY=1 WANT_WIN_CURSES=1 CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 package

    Result: The "make package" target will bundle all of the necessary
            components to run NetHack on msdos into a folder:
                targets/msdos/pkg
            and then it zips the contents of that folder into:
                targets/msdos/nh370dos.zip

    Also note that building the msdos targets using the make command
    above, does not preclude you from building local linux or macOS
    targets as well. Just drop the CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 from the make
    command line. That's because the cross-compiler hints additions are
    enclosed inside ifdef sections and won't interfere with the
    non-cross-compile build in that case.

  | B5. Case sample: amiga  |
  +-------------------------+

Disclaimer: This is a minimal recipe, just to help someone else get
            started if they have a desire to get a full cross-compile of
            NetHack going for the Amiga.
            See CAVEATS below.

Cross-compiler used:     bebbo's amiga-gcc
Cross-compiler url:      https://github.com/bebbo/amiga-gcc

    To our knowledge, a pre-built copy of the cross-compiler isn't available,
    so you will likely have to obtain the cross-compiler sources via git and
    build it on your system.

    The build prerequisite packages for building the compiler on Ubuntu can be
    easily obtained:

        sudo apt install make wget git gcc g++ lhasa libgmp-dev \
            libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev flex bison gettext texinfo ncurses-dev \
            autoconf rsync

    The build prerequisite packages for macOS via homebrew are documented but
    not tested by us any of us to date.

        brew install bash wget make lhasa gmp mpfr libmpc flex gettext \
        texinfo gcc make autoconf

    After installing the prerequite packages and the cross-compiler
    it was a straightforward build:

            git clone https://github.com/bebbo/amiga-gcc.git
            cd amiga-gcc
            make update

           [Note that you may have to take ownership of the files in the bebbo
            repo via chown before succesfully carrying out the next steps]

            make clean
            make clean-prefix
            date; make all -j3 >&b.log; date

    The compiler pieces are installed in /opt/amiga by default. If you prefer,
    you can alter the prefix before you build if you want. The instructions
    for doing so were spelled out at the time of this writing at:

        https://github.com/bebbo/amiga-gcc

    On your linux host:

        cd sys/unix ; sh setup.sh hints/linux.2020 ; cd ../..
        make fetch-lua

    On your macOS host:

        cd sys/unix ; sh setup.sh hints/macOS.2020 ; cd ../..
        make fetch-lua

    The Amiga cross-compile can then be carried out by specifying
    CROSS_TO_AMIGA=1 on the make command line:

        make CROSS_TO_AMIGA=1 all
        make CROSS_TO_AMIGA=1 package

    You can explicitly include tty and curses support if desired, otherwise
    you'll end up with a tty-only cross-compile build. The SDL1 pdcurses
    support has not been tested.

        make WANT_WIN_TTY=1 WANT_WIN_CURSES=1 CROSS_TO_AMIGA=1 all

    Result: The "make package" target will bundle the (hopefully) necessary
            components to run NetHack on msdos into a folder:
                targets/amiga/pkg
            and then it zips the contents of that folder into:
                targets/amiga/nh370ami.zip

    Also note that building the amiga targets using the make command
    above, does not preclude you from building local linux or macOS
    targets as well. Just drop the CROSS_TO_AMIGA=1 from the make
    command line.

    The cross-compiler hints additions are enclosed inside ifdef sections
    and won't interfere with the non-cross-compile build in that case.

    CAVEATS: The original NetHack Amiga build steps included the source for
             some utilities that were built and executed on the amiga:
                 txt2iff and xpm2iff
             as part of the NetHack build procedure on amiga.
             Those did not compile out-of-the-box on the linux host. They
             will either have to be:
             - ported to build and run on the linux or macOS cross-compile
               host
          or

             - their functionality will have to be rolled into amiga NetHack
               itself and executed on the target Amiga the first time the game
               is run, perhaps.

    If you make headway, or are successful getting a working copy of
    NetHack going on the amiga, drop us a note at devteam@nethack.org.

  | B6. Case sample: Web Assembly  |
  +--------------------------------+

Credit: The initial Web Assembly cross compile was found in a pull request:
            https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/pull/385
        by apowers313. The pull request was merged with some accompanying
        NetHack source tree integration changes in early October 2020.

Cross-compiler used: emscripten
Cross-compiler url: https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html

    Here's a brief guide to obtaining the cross-compiler sources via git and
    building it on your system.

    For Ubuntu, the build prerequisite packages for building the compiler can
    be easily obtained:

        sudo apt-get install python3 cmake default-jre

    For macOS, you will need to install Xcode, git, cmake, Python 3.5 or new
    (at time of this writing).

    After installing the prerequite packages above, obtain the cross-compiler
    via git and build it from the directory of your choice using steps similar
    to these:

            git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
            cd emsdk
            git pull
            ./emsdk install latest
            ./emsdk activate latest
            source ./emsdk_env.sh

    The steps above reflect what was outlined at this url at the time
    of writing:

            https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html

    That is the definitive source and trumps anything documented here.

    On your linux host, prepare to cross-compile NetHack as follows:

        cd sys/unix ; sh setup.sh hints/linux.2020 ; cd ../..
        make fetch-lua

    On your macOS host, prepare to cross-compile NetHack as follows:

        cd sys/unix ; sh setup.sh hints/macOS.2020 ; cd ../..
        make fetch-lua

    Then, cross-compile to targets/wasm as follows:

        make CROSS_TO_WASM=1

    You can build src/nethacklib.a from pull request 385 as follows:

        make WANT_LIBNH=1

    Do not add any additional windowport interfaces to your build
    (such as WANT_WIN_TTY=1 WANT_WIN_CURSES=1 WANT_WIN_X11=1 or
    WANT_WIN_QT=1) as those aren't applicable to the Web Assembly
    or nethacklib builds. A "shim" pseudo-windowport is included
    from pull request 385.

    Result: As mentioned, the wasm cross-compile will end up in 
            targets/wasm and the nethacklib.a will end up
            src.

    The cross-compiler hints additions are enclosed inside ifdef sections
    and shouldn't interfere with the non-cross-compile builds using
    hints/linux.2020 or hints/macOS.2020.
