# Sample sysconf file for VMS.
# The sysconf file is only used if NetHack is compiled with SYSCF defined.
# It can be used to augment or override certain settings compiled into the
# program.
#
# This file can also be used to set local system defaults for run-time
# options, using the same syntax as an individual user's ./nethackrc file.

# The options which take a space-separated list of usernames haven't been
# implemented for VMS.

# Limit the number of simultaneous games.  (Setting a limit has a side-effect
# of changing the file names for the games in progress.  With no limit, they
# are named NNNcccccc.*, when NNN is a decimal formatting of the users's UIC
# value (group * 65536 + member; orinarily formatted as a pair of numbers
# expressed in octal, [group,member]) and cccccc is the character name.
# With a limit, they are named Llock.*, where L is a single letter.)
# Limit is documented to be 25 even though 26 is easily feasible....
#MAXPLAYERS=10

# If not null, added to string "To get local support, " in the support
# information help.
#SUPPORT=call Izchak at extension 42.

# If not null, displayed at the end of a panic-save sequence.
#RECOVER=Run the recover program.

# Uncomment the next line to disable the SEDUCE option, causing succubi and
# incubi to use nymphs' charm behavior rather than their own seduce behavior.
#SEDUCE=0

# Uncomment to disable savefile UID checking.

# Record (high score) file options.
# CAUTION: changing these after people have started playing games can
#  lead to lost high scores!

# Number of bones file pools.
# The pool you belong to is determined at game start. You will
# load and save bones only from that pool. Generally useful
# for public servers only.
# Changing this might make existing bones inaccessible.
# Disabled by setting to 0, or commenting out.
#BONES_POOLS=10

# Show debugging information originating from these source files.
# Use '*' for all, or list source files separated by spaces.
# Only available if game has been compiled with DEBUG, and can be
# overridden via DEBUGFILES environment variable.

# Try to get more info in case of a program bug or crash.  Only used
# if the program is built with the PANICTRACE compile-time option enabled.
# By default PANICTRACE is enabled if (NH_DEVEL_STATUS != NH_STATUS_RELEASED), 
# otherwise disabled.
# (GDBPATH, GREPPATH, and PANICTRACE_LIBC aren't used on VMS.
# PANICTRACE_GDB is repurposed, with nothing to do with 'gdb'.
# Values are 1: show traceback and exit, 2: show traceback and
# remain in debugger.)

# Ordinary run-time options can be set here to override the builtin-in

# still choose their own option settings via NETHACKOPTIONS in their
# environment or via sys$login:nethack.ini run-time configuration file.
