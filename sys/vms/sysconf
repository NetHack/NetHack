# Sample sysconf file for VMS.
# The sysconf file is only used if NetHack is compiled with SYSCF defined.
# It can be used to augment or override certain settings compiled into the
# program.
#
# This file can also be used to set local system defaults for run-time
# options, using the same syntax as an individual user's ./nethackrc file.

# The options which take a space-separated list of usernames haven't been
# implemented for VMS.
#WIZARDS=
#EXPLORERS=*
#SHELLERS=

# If the user name is found in this list, prompt for username instead.
# Uses the same syntax as the WIZARDS option above.
# A public server should probably disable this.
GENERICUSERS=play player game games nethack nethacker

# Use the character name for matching WIZARDS, EXPLORERS and SHELLERS,
# instead of the user's login name.
#CHECK_PLNAME=1

# Limit the number of simultaneous games.  (Setting a limit has a side-effect
# of changing the file names for the games in progress.  With no limit, they
# are named NNNcccccc.*, when NNN is a decimal formatting of the users's UIC
# value (group * 65536 + member; ordinarily formatted as a pair of numbers
# expressed in octal, [group,member]) and cccccc is the character name.
# With a limit, they are named Llock.*, where L is a single letter.)
# Limit is documented to be 25 even though 26 is easily feasible....
#MAXPLAYERS=10

# If not null, added to string "To get local support, " in the support
# information help.
#SUPPORT=call Izchak at extension 42.

# If not null, displayed at the end of a panic-save sequence.
#RECOVER=Run the recover program.

# Uncomment the next line to disable the SEDUCE option, causing succubi and
# incubi to use nymphs' charm behavior rather than their own seduce behavior.
#SEDUCE=0

# Uncomment the next line to enable some accessibility features such
# as S_hero_override and S_pet_override symbols for screen readers
# in the user config file.
#ACCESSIBILITY=1

# Uncomment to disable savefile UID checking.
#CHECK_SAVE_UID=0

# Record (high score) file options.
# CAUTION: changing these after people have started playing games can
#  lead to lost high scores!
# Maximum entries for one person.
#PERSMAX=10
# Maximum entries in the record file.
#ENTRYMAX=100
# Minimum points to get an entry.
#POINTSMIN=1
# Determine identity of "person" in the score file with name (0) or
# numeric (1) user id.
#PERS_IS_UID=1

# Help menu control; 0 - include "command line usage" entry in help menu;
# 1 - suppress it from the menu.  Does not affect 'nethack --usage' when
# player has access to the command line.  The usage feedback describes
# command line handling for UNIX so enabling it won't be much use here.
HIDEUSAGE=1

# Maximum number of score file entries to use for random statue names

# Use "Live logging" for important events (achievements, wishes, etc)
# Only available if NetHack was compiled with LIVELOG.
# Only really meaningful for public servers.
# See the log in-game with #chronicle -command.
# Bitmask for kinds of things you want to log - combine the following values
# as desired.
# 0x0000 - No live logging (default)
# 0x0001 - Wishes
# 0x0002 - Significant achievements (complete sokoban, perform invocation, etc)
# 0x0004 - Kill, destroy or bribe a unique monster.
# 0x0008 - Significant religious events (sacrifice gifts, crowning)
# 0x0010 - Life-saving
# 0x0020 - Break conduct - see also LLC_TURNS below.
# 0x0040 - Artifact obtained (#name Sting, dip for Excalibur)
# 0x0080 - Genocides
# 0x0100 - Murder of tame pet
# 0x0200 - Changed alignment temporarily or permanently
# 0x0400 - Log URL for dumplog if ascended
# 0x0800 - Log dumplog url for all games
# 0x1000 - Log 'minor' achievements - can be spammy
# 0x2000 - Spoiler event; can include in livelog but hidden from #chronicle
# 0x4000 - Include as 'major' event in dumplog; can be hidden from livelog
# 0x8000 - Livelog debug msgs (currently only 'enter new level')
#LIVELOG=0x1FFF

# Show debugging information originating from these source files.
# Use '*' for all, or list source files separated by spaces.
# Only available if game has been compiled with DEBUG, and can be
# overridden via DEBUGFILES environment variable.
#DEBUGFILES=*

# Save end of game dump log to this file.
# Only available if NetHack was compiled with DUMPLOG
# Allows following placeholders:
#   %% literal '%'
#   %v version (eg. "3.7.0-0")
#   %u game UID
#   %t game start time, UNIX timestamp format
#   %T current time, UNIX timestamp format

#   %D current time, YYYYMMDDhhmmss format
#   %n player name
#   %N first character of player name
#DUMPLOGFILE=/tmp/nethack.%n.%d.log

# Number of bones file pools.
# The pool you belong to is determined at game start. You will
# load and save bones only from that pool. Generally useful
# for public servers only.
# Changing this might make existing bones inaccessible.
# Disabled by setting to 0, or commenting out.
#BONES_POOLS=10

# Try to get more info in case of a program bug or crash.  Only used
# if the program is built with the PANICTRACE compile-time option enabled.
# By default PANICTRACE is enabled if (NH_DEVEL_STATUS != NH_STATUS_RELEASED), 
# otherwise disabled.
# (GDBPATH, GREPPATH, and PANICTRACE_LIBC aren't used on VMS.
# PANICTRACE_GDB is repurposed, with nothing to do with 'gdb'.
# Values are 1: show traceback and exit, 2: show traceback and
# remain in debugger.)

# 'portable_device_paths' is only supported for Windows.  Starting with
# 3.6.3, nethack on Windows treats the folder containing nethack.exe and
# nethackW.exe as read-only and puts data files which are generated or
# modified during play or by the user in assorted folders derived from
# user name.  3.6.4 added PORTABLE_DEVICE_PATHS to allow reverting to
# the old behavior of having the run-time configuration file and other
# data in the same directory as the executable so that the whole thing
# can be moved from one machine to another (flash drive or perhaps cloud)
# without updating folder paths.
#PORTABLE_DEVICE_PATHS=0

# Ordinary run-time options can be set here to override the builtin-in
# default values.  Unlike all the SYSCF values above, individual users
# can override the overridden options set here by choosing their own
# option settings via NETHACKOPTIONS in their environment or via
# sys$login:nethack.ini run-time configuration file.
#OPTIONS=!autopickup,fruit:tomato,symset:DECgraphics
