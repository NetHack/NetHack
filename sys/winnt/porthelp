                   (Last Revision: August 8, 2020)

This file details specifics for NetHack built for Windows 95, 98, NT, 
Me, 2000, and XP. Users of really early 16-bit Windows versions should 
use the MSDOS NetHack. 

Please note that "NetHack for Windows - Graphical Interface" requires 
an installation of Internet Explorer 4 or an installation of 
version 4.71 of the common controls. See the following internet page: 
    http://www.nethack.org/v340/ports/download-win.html#cc
for more information. If the game runs for you, you are not affected.

New players should be sure to read GuideBook.txt which contains 
essential information about playing NetHack. It can be found in the
same directory as your NetHack executable.

The NetHack for Windows port supports some additional or enhanced 
commands as well as some defaults.nh file options specific to 
configuration choices used during the building of NetHack for 
Windows. Listed below are those commands and defaults.nh file 
options. 

Some options are applicable only to the "Graphical Interface." 
These are discussed separately in their own section.

1. ALT Key Combinations
----------------------------------------------
The non-graphical (tty) interface always operates in "NetHack mode",
while the "NetHack for Windows - Graphical Interface" lets you
toggle the mode.  In non-NetHack mode, all ALT-key combinations
are sent to the Windows itself, rather than to NetHack.

While playing in NetHack mode you can press the ALT key in 
combination with another key to execute an extended command
as an alternative method to pressing a # key sequence.
The available commands are:

    Alt-2    #twoweapon      - toggle two-weapon combat (unavailable
                               if number_pad mode is set)
    Alt-a    #adjust         - adjust inventory letters.
    Alt-c    #chat           - talk to someone or something.
    Alt-d    #dip            - dip an object into something.
    Alt-e    #enhance        - enhance your skill with a weapon.
    Alt-f    #force          - force a lock.
    Alt-i    #invoke         - invoke an object's powers.
    Alt-j    #jump           - jump to a location.
    Alt-l    #loot           - loot a box on the floor.
    Alt-m    #monster        - use a monster's special ability. 
    Alt-n    #name           - name an item or type of object.
    Alt-o    #offer          - offer a sacrifice to the gods.
    Alt-p    #pray           - pray to the gods for help.
    Alt-q    #quit           - quit the game. (Same as #quit)
    Alt-r    #rub            - rub a lamp.
    Alt-s    #sit            - sit down.
    Alt-t    #turn           - turn undead.
    Alt-u    #untrap         - untrap something.
    Alt-v    #version        - list compile time options for this version of
                               NetHack.
    Alt-w    #wipe           - wipe off your face.
    Alt-?    #?              - display list of extended menu commands

2. Boolean Options (Options that can be toggled on or off)
----------------------------------------------------------

Listed here are any options not discussed in the main help, options 
which may be slightly different from the main help file, and options 
which may need a slightly more explanatory note: 

    color          Use color when displaying non-tiled maps. Tiled 
                   maps (available in the graphical port) are always 
                   rendered in color. Default: [TRUE]

    hilite_pet     Using tiled graphics, displays a small heart symbol
                   next to your pet.  Using ascii graphics, the pet is
                   hilited in a white background.
                   Default: [TRUE]

    IBMgraphics    Use IBM extended characters for the dungeon 
                   Default: [TRUE] 
 
    msg_window     When ^P is pressed, it shows menu in a full window.
                   Available only in the non-graphical (tty) version.
                   Default: [FALSE] 

    toptenwin      Write top ten list to a window, as opposed to stdout.
                   Default in tty interface: [FALSE]
		   Default in graphical interface: [TRUE] (and cannot be changed)

3. Options that you assign a value to (Graphical Interface only)
----------------------------------------------------------------

"NetHack for Windows - Graphical Interface" recognizes the following 
additional options, which the non-graphical (tty) version will
silently ignore.  These are options that specify attributes of various
windows.  The windows that you can tailor include menu windows (such 
as the inventory list), text windows (such as "It is written in the 
book of ..." screens), the message window (where events of the game are
displayed), the status window (where your character name
and attributes are displayed), and the map window (where the map
is drawn).

Window Alignment options:

    align_message  Specifies at which side of the NetHack screen the 
                   message window is aligned. This option can be used 
                   to align the window to "top" or "bottom".
                   Default: [TOP] 

    align_status   Specifies at which side of the NetHack screen the 
                   status window is aligned. This option can be used
                   to align the window to "top" or "bottom".
                   Default: [BOTTOM] 

Map Window options:

    map_mode       Specifies which map mode to use. 
                   The following map modes are available: 
                   tiles (display things on the map with colored tiles), 
                   ascii4x6, ascii6x8, ascii8x8, ascii16x8, ascii7x12,
                   ascii8x12, ascii16x12, ascii12x16, ascii10x18
                   (which use that size font to display things on 
                   the map), or fit_to_screen (an ascii mode which
                   forces things to fit on a single screen).
                   Default: [tiles]

    scroll_margin  Specifies the number of map cells from the edge
                   of the map window where scrolling will take place.
                   Default: [5] 

    tile_file      An alternative file containing bitmap to use for 
                   tiles. This file should be a .bmp file and should 
                   be organized as 40 rectangular tiles wide. It is 
                   beyond the scope of this document to describe the 
                   exact contents of each tile in the .bmp, which must
                   match the object lists used when building NetHack.

    tile_height    Used with tile_file to specify the height of each 
                   tile in pixels. This option may only be specified
                   in the defaults.nh config file.
                   Default: [16] 

    tile_width     Used with tile_file to specify the width of each 
                   tile in pixels. This option may only be specified
                   in the defaults.nh config file. 
                   Default: [16]

Other Window options:

    windowcolors   Specifies the colors for various windows
                   This option may only be specified in the
                   defaults.nh config file and has the following
                   format:
                       window-type foreground/background
                   Notes:
                      - Both foreground and background colors are
                        required, and a slash must separate them.
                      - "window-type" is either "message" or "status"
                        (Short forms are: "msg" or "sts").
                      - "foreground" and "background" may be specified as
                        a color name (such as "blue"), or by a six
                        digit hexadecimal RGB color value (such as
                        "#8F8F8F")
                      - The following color names are available:
                        black, red, green, brown, blue, magenta,
                        cyan, gray (or grey), orange, brightgreen,
                        yellow, brightblue, brightmagenta, brightcyan,
                        white, trueblack, purple, silver, maroon, fuchsia,
                        lime, olive, navy, teal, aqua. In addition, you 
                        can use the following names to refer to default 
                        Windows settings: activeborder, activecaption, 
                        appworkspace, background, btnface, btnshadow, btntext, 
                        captiontext, graytext, highlight, highlighttext, 
                        inactiveborder, inactivecaption, menu, menutext, 
                        scrollbar, window, windowframe, windowtext.

                        Example:
                        OPTIONS=windowcolors:sts #00FF80/blue msg menutext/menu

Miscellaneous options: 

    vary_msgcount  Number of lines to display in message window. 


4. NetHack for Windows - Graphical Interface, Additional/Enhanced Commands
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following function keys are active in
the "NetHack for Windows - Graphical Interface": 

    F4             Toggle level overview mode on/off 
                   This key will toggle the map between a view that 
                   is mapped to fit exactly to the window, and the 
                   view that shows the various symbols in their 
                   normal size. This is useful for getting an idea 
                   of where you are in a level. 

    F5             Toggle tiled display on/off. 
                   This key switches between the tiled and the 
                   traditional ASCII display. This is equivalent to 
                   using the "map_mode" option. 

    F10            Activate menu bar. 
                   This key will activate the menu bar, allowing you 
                   to select between the menus: File, Map, 
                   Window Settings, and Help. 

5. Graphical Port Menus
-----------------------

File
  Save - Allows you to save and exit the game
  Quit - Allows you to quit the game

Map - Provides for selection of map mode. Equivalent to using 
the map_mode option. 

Window Settings - Changes your logged-on user's settings for NetHack.
In 3.5.0, only one setting is available: NetHack mode, which can be
checked or unchecked. NetHack mode allows you to use the ALT key for
game key commands [see list above]. You can use F10 to access the
menu bar while in NetHack mode. You can also clear your logged-on
user's settings for NetHack. Settings in this window are saved in
your logged-on user's registry. 

Help - Provides help about various portions of NetHack.


6. Numeric Keypad (for "OPTION=number_pad" mode)
------------------------------------------------

The numeric keypad and surrounding characters act as macros for different
commands in NetHack.  The Num Lock should be toggled to "on" to make the
most of these keys:

          Key         Normal       Shift-Key
       ----------   ----------    -------------
       1, 2, 3, 4   Move In       Run In
       6, 7, 8, 9   Direction     Direction

        0 (Ins)     Inventory     Categorized
                                  Inventory

        . (Del)     Wait Turn     : - Look Here

        +           Spell List    P - Put on an
                                  accessory

        -           m - Move      Previous
                    Only          Message

    NetHack for Windows - tty Interface Specific Behavior:
    ------------------------------------------------------

      In the non-graphical (tty) interface, when you use the Ctrl key with a
      directional key (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) it means "go in specified
      direction until you hit a wall or run into something interesting."

    NetHack for Windows - Graphical Interface Specific Behavior:
    ------------------------------------------------------------

      It is possible to scroll or pan the map in a specific direction:

        Ctrl-Shift-Left  (4)     Scroll (Pan) map left
        Ctrl-Shift-Right (6)     Scroll (Pan) map right
        Ctrl-Shift-Up    (8)     Scroll (Pan) map up
