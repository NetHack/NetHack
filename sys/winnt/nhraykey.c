 * Keystroke handling contributed by Ray Chason.
 * The following text was written by Ray Chason.
 *
 * The problem
 * ===========
 *
 * The console-mode Nethack wants both keyboard and mouse input.  The
 * problem is that the Windows API provides no easy way to get mouse input
 * and also keyboard input properly translated according to the user's
 * chosen keyboard layout.
 *
 * The ReadConsoleInput function returns a stream of keyboard and mouse
 * events.  Nethack is interested in those events that represent a key
 * pressed, or a click on a mouse button.  The keyboard events from
 * ReadConsoleInput are not translated according to the keyboard layout,
 * and do not take into account the shift, control, or alt keys.
 *
 * The PeekConsoleInput function works similarly to ReadConsoleInput,
 * except that it does not remove an event from the queue and it returns
 * instead of blocking when the queue is empty.
 *
 * A program can also use ReadConsole to get a properly translated stream
 * of characters.  Unfortunately, ReadConsole does not return mouse events,
 * does not distinguish the keypad from the main keyboard, does not return
 * keys shifted with Alt, and does not even return the ESC key when
 * pressed.
 *
 * We want both the functionality of ReadConsole and the functionality of
 * ReadConsoleInput.  But Microsoft didn't seem to think of that.
 *
 *
 * The solution, in the original code
 * ==================================
 *
 * The original 3.4.1 distribution tries to get proper keyboard translation
 * by passing keyboard events to the ToAscii function.  This works, to some
 * extent -- it takes the shift key into account, and it processes dead
 * keys properly.  But it doesn't take non-US keyboards into account.  It
 * appears that ToAscii is meant for windowed applications, and does not
 * have enough information to do its job properly in a console application.
 *
 *
 * The Finnish keyboard patch
 * ==========================
 *
 * This patch adds the "subkeyvalue" option to the defaults.nh file.  The
 * user can then add OPTIONS=sukeyvalue:171/92, for instance, to replace
 * the 171 character with 92, which is \.  This works, once properly
 * configured, but places too much burden on the user.  It also bars the
 * use of the substituted characters in naming objects or monsters.
 *
 *
 * The solution presented here
 * ===========================
 *
 * The best way I could find to combine the functionality of ReadConsole
 * with that of ReadConsoleInput is simple in concept.  First, call
 * PeekConsoleInput to get the first event.  If it represents a key press,
 * call ReadConsole to retrieve the key.  Otherwise, pop it off the queue
 * with ReadConsoleInput and, if it's a mouse click, return it as such.
 *
 * But the Devil, as they say, is in the details.  The problem is in
 * recognizing an event that ReadConsole will return as a key.  We don't
 * want to call ReadConsole unless we know that it will immediately return:
 * if it blocks, the mouse and the Alt sequences will cease to function
 * until it returns.
 *
 * Separating process_keystroke into two functions, one for commands and a
 * new one, process_keystroke2, for answering prompts, makes the job a lot
 * easier.  process_keystroke2 doesn't have to worry about mouse events or
 * Alt sequences, and so the consequences are minor if ReadConsole blocks.
 * process_keystroke, OTOH, never needs to return a non-ASCII character
 * that was read from ReadConsole; it returns bytes with the high bit set
 * only in response to an Alt sequence.
 *
 * So in process_keystroke, before calling ReadConsole, a bogus key event
 * is pushed on the queue.  This event causes ReadConsole to return, even
 * if there was no other character available.  Because the bogus key has
 * the eighth bit set, it is filtered out.  This is not done in
 * process_keystroke2, because that would render dead keys unusable.
 *
 * A separate process_keystroke2 can also process the numeric keypad in a
 * way that makes sense for prompts:  just return the corresponding symbol,
 * and pay no mind to number_pad or the num lock key.
 *
 * The recognition of Alt sequences is modified, to support the use of
 * characters generated with the AltGr key.  A keystroke is an Alt sequence
 * if an Alt key is seen that can't be an AltGr (since an AltGr sequence
 * could be a character, and in some layouts it could even be an ASCII
 * character).  This recognition is different on NT-based and 95-based
 * Windows:
 *
 *    * On NT-based Windows, AltGr signals as right Alt and left Ctrl
 *      together.  So an Alt sequence is recognized if either Alt key is
 *      pressed and if right Alt and left Ctrl are not both present.  This
 *      is true even if the keyboard in use does not have an AltGr key, and
 *      uses right Alt for AltGr.
 *
 *    * On 95-based Windows, with a keyboard that lacks the AltGr key, the
 *      right Alt key is used instead.  But it still signals as right Alt,
 *      without left Ctrl.  There is no way for the application to know
 *      whether right Alt is Alt or AltGr, and so it is always assumed
 *      to be AltGr.  This means that Alt sequences must be formed with
 *      left Alt.
 *
 * So the patch processes keystrokes as follows:
 *
 *     * If the scan and virtual key codes are both 0, it's the bogus key,
 *       and we ignore it.
 *
 *     * Keys on the numeric keypad are processed for commands as in the
 *       unpatched Nethack, and for prompts by returning the ASCII
 *       character, even if the num lock is off.
 *
 *     * Alt sequences are processed for commands as in the unpatched
 *       Nethack, and ignored for prompts.
 *
 *     * Control codes are returned as received, because ReadConsole will
 *       not return the ESC key.
 *
 *     * Other key-down events are passed to ReadConsole.  The use of
 *       ReadConsole is different for commands than for prompts:
 *
 *       o For commands, the bogus key is pushed onto the queue before
 *         ReadConsole is called.  On return, non-ASCII characters are
 *         filtered, so they are not mistaken for Alt sequences; this also
 *         filters the bogus key.
 *
 *       o For prompts, the bogus key is not used, because that would
 *         interfere with dead keys.  Eight bit characters may be returned,
 *         and are coded in the configured code page.
 *
 *
 * Possible improvements
 * =====================
 *
 * Some possible improvements remain:
 *
 *     * Integrate the existing Finnish keyboard patch, for use with non-
 *       QWERTY layouts such as the German QWERTZ keyboard or Dvorak.
 *
 *     * Fix the keyboard glitches in the graphical version.  Namely, dead
 *       keys don't work, and input comes in as ISO-8859-1 but is displayed
 *       as code page 437 if IBMgraphics is set on startup.
 *
 *     * Transform incoming text to ISO-8859-1, for full compatibility with
 *       the graphical version.
 *
 *     * After pushing the bogus key and calling ReadConsole, check to see
 *       if we got the bogus key; if so, and an Alt is pressed, process the
 *       event as an Alt sequence.
