# *** LOCATIONS ***
# IMPORTANT: If you change any of these locations, the directories they
# point at must exist.  NetHack will not create them for you.
#
# HACKDIR is the default location for everything.
# Note: On Windows HACKDIR defaults to the location 
#       of the NetHack.exe or NetHackw.exe file so
#       setting HACKDIR below to override that is 
#       not usually necessary or recommended.
