#SHELLERS=

# Show debugging information originating from these source files.
# Use '*' for all, or list source files separated by spaces.
# Only available if game has been compiled with DEBUG.
#DEBUGFILES=*

# Save end of game dump log to this file.
# Only available if NetHack was compiled with DUMPLOG
# Allows following placeholders:
#   %% literal '%'
#   %v version (eg. "3.6.1-0")
#   %u game UID
#   %t game start time, UNIX timestamp format
#   %T current time, UNIX timestamp format
#   %d game start time, YYYYMMDDhhmmss format
#   %D current time, YYYYMMDDhhmmss format
#   %n player name

#DUMPLOGFILE=nethack-%n-%d.log

# Limit the number of simultaneous games (see also nethack.sh).
#MAXPLAYERS=10

# If not null, added to string "To get local support, " in the support
# information help.
#SUPPORT=call Izchak at extension 42.

# Uncomment the next line to disable the SEDUCE option.
#SEDUCE=0

# Record (high score) file options.
# CAUTION: changing these after people have started playing games can
#  lead to lost high scores!
# Maximum entries for one person.
#PERSMAX=10
# Maximum entries in the record file.
#ENTRYMAX=100
# Minimum points to get an entry.
#POINTSMIN=1
# Determine identity of "person" in the score file with name (0) or
# numeric (1) user id.
#PERS_IS_UID=1

# Maximum number of score file entries to use for random statue names
#MAX_STATUENAME_RANK=10

# Use "Live logging" for in-game progress (achievements, wishes, etc)
# Bitmask for kinds of things you want to log - sum the following values
# as desired.
# 0 - No live logging
# 1 - Traditional 3.4.3-nao style logging (wishes, lifesaves, invocation, planes)
# 2 - Achievements, as recorded in the achievement bitfield.
# 4 - Unique kills (Juiblex, Famine, Quest nemesis, etc)
# 8 - Significant religious events (sacrifice gifts, crowning)
# 16 - Not used (yet)
# 32 - Break conduct - can be spammy early-game
# 64 - Enter new level for the first time (excruciatingly verbose but good for testing)
# 128 - reserved for temporary debugging and/or tournament use
# Enabled at compile time by defining LIVELOGFILE in config.h
# LIVELOG=63

# Do not livelog breaking of conducts before this turncount
# Cuts down on spam
# LLC_TURNS=3000

# *** LOCATIONS ***
# IMPORTANT: If you change any of these locations, the directories they
# point at must exist.  NetHack will not create them for you.
#
# HACKDIR is the default location for everything.
# Note: On Windows HACKDIR defaults to the location 
#       of the NetHack.exe or NetHackw.exe file so
#       setting HACKDIR below to override that is 
#       not usually necessary or recommended.
#HACKDIR=c:\games\nethack
#
# The location that users can adjust their config file startup options
#CONFIGDIR=c:\games\nethack
#
# The location that level files in progress are stored (default=HACKDIR, writeable)
#LEVELDIR=c:\nethack\levels
#
# The location where saved games are kept (default=HACKDIR, writeable)
#SAVEDIR=c:\nethack\save
#
# The location that bones files are kept (default=HACKDIR, writeable)
#BONESDIR=c:\nethack\save
#
# The location that file synchronization locks are stored (default=HACKDIR, writeable)
#LOCKDIR=c:\nethack\levels
#
# The location that a record of game aborts and self-diagnosed game problems
# is kept (default=HACKDIR, writeable)
#TROUBLEDIR=c:\nethack\trouble
