Credit for the porting of NetHack to the Win32 Console Subsystem goes to 
the NT Porting Team started by Michael Allison.

Credit for the Win32 Graphical version of NetHack (aka "NetHack for
Windows" or NetHackW) goes to Alex Kompel who initially developed and
contributed the port.

The PC Windows porting team consisting of Michael Allison, David Cohrs, 
Alex Kompel, Dion Nicolaas, Yitzhak Sapir, and Janet Walz maintained the 
tty and graphical win32 versions of NetHack 3.6.0.

You can build a TTY version of NetHack and a Windows Graphical 
version.  You can use one of the following build environments:

  o A copy of Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Express
    The current NetHack code has not been tested with earlier versions 
    of the compiler.
    
    OR

  o A copy of MinGW. MinGW is a collection of header 
    files and import libraries with which native Windows32 programs 
    can be built; the MinGW distribution contains the GNU Compiler 
    Collection. You can download MinGW at
        http://www.mingw.org/
    Earlier versions of MinGW will not allow you to build the Windows
    Graphical version.
    
In addition to the makefiles that allow you to build NetHack from the
command line, there is also a set of project files and a workspace file
that allow you to build the Windows Graphical version from Microsoft
Visual C's IDE (Integrated Development Environment.)


/-----------------------------------\
| FIRST STEP - MOVING THINGS AROUND |
\-----------------------------------/

The first step in building either version of NetHack is to execute
sys\winnt\nhsetup.bat to move some files to their required locations.  

From the command prompt:
	cd sys\winnt
	nhsetup

From a Windows explorer window:
	double-click on nhsetup.bat

A "binary" directory will be created off the top of the NetHack source
tree to house the completed build.

A build subdirectory will also be created off the top of the NetHack 
source tree, and many files appropriate for a graphical build will be 
moved there.

If you wish to build from the command line, proceed to "BUILDING FROM
THE COMMAND LINE."

If you wish to build using Visual C's IDE, proceed now to "BUILDING
USING VISUAL C'S IDE."

/--------------------------------\
| BUILDING FROM THE COMMAND LINE |
\--------------------------------/

Two different versions of NetHack will be built for Windows from the
command line using the Makefile approach:
    A tty port utilizing the Win32 Console I/O subsystem, Console
        NetHack;
    A Win32 native port built on the Windows API, Graphical NetHack or
        NetHackW.

The executable for Console NetHack will be named NetHack.exe. The
executable for Graphical NetHack will be named NetHackW.exe. The 
Makefile configuration will build both; NetHackW.exe and NetHack.exe
will be able to use the same datafiles, save files and bones files.

Since the last official release of NetHack, compilers and computer 
architectures have evolved and you can now choose whether to build
a 32-bit x86 version, or a 64-bit x64 version.  The default Makefile
is set up for a 32-bit x86 version, but that's only because it will 
run on the most number of existing Windows environments.

NetHack's save files and bones files in the 3.6.0 release have not 
evolved enough to allow them to interchange between the 32-bit version 
and the 64-bit version (or between different platforms). Hopefully
that will change in an upcoming release.

I. Dispelling the Myths:

    Compiling NetHack for Windows is not as easy as it sounds, nor as hard
    as it looks, however it will behoove you to read this entire section 
    through before beginning the task.

    We have provided a Makefile for each of the following compilers:

        o Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Express Visual C++ Compiler
        o MinGW 2.0 (with GCC 3.2)

    The Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Express Makefile was created for use 
    with MS NMAKE which is provided with the Microsoft compiler. 
    The supplied Makefile may work with earlier versions of the Microsoft
    compiler, but that has not been tested. 

    The GCC Makefile was created for use with GNU Make version 3.79.1,
    which comes with the MinGW package.

    You may find it useful to obtain copies of lex (flex) and yacc
    (bison, or byacc).  While not strictly necessary to compile nethack,
    they are required should you desire to make any changes to the level
    and dungeon compilers.

II. To compile your copy of NetHack on a Windows machine:

Setting Up

1.  It almost goes without saying that you should make sure that your 
    tools are set up and running correctly.  That includes ensuring that
    all the necessary environment variables for the compiler environment
    are set correctly. 

    Visual Studio 2013 Express

    The installation should have placed a command prompt option on the 
    Start menus that is properly configured for building: 
                 From
                     Start | All Programs | Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Express
                 Select
                     Visual Studio Command Prompt 2013
 
    Anyway, once you are at a command prompt (cmd.exe) regardless of how you
    got there, you can use one of the following sets of commands to prepare 
    your environment for building:

    For a 32-bit x86 build (like the official binary):
        cd "\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC"
        vcvarsall x86

    For a 64-bit x64 build:
        cd "\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC"
        vcvarsall x86_amd64

      -----------------------------------------------------------
      vcvarsall.bat | Compiler   | Build-computer | Build output
      argument      |            | architecture   | architecture
      --------------+------------+----------------+--------------
      X86           | x86 32-bit | x86, x64       | x86
                    | native     |                |
      --------------+------------+----------------+--------------
      x86_amd64     | x64 on x86 | x86, x64       | x64
                    | cross      |                |
      --------------+------------+----------------+--------------
      amd64         | x64 64-bit | x64            | x64
                    | native     |                |
      --------------+------------+----------------+--------------
      amd64_x86     | x86 on     | x64            | x86
                    | x64 cross  |                |
      -----------------------------------------------------------

    Change your current directory to the src subfolder of the nethack 
    source tree.
        cd src

    At this time, if you are determined to build an x64 version
    with the Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 compiler,
    one extra NetHack-specific step is needed. Edit the Makefile in the src 
    directory and change this in the section marked as 1.:
           #
           # 64 bit
           #TARGET_CPU=x64
           #
           # 32 bit
           TARGET_CPU=x86
    to this:
           #
           # 64 bit
           TARGET_CPU=x64
           #
           # 32 bit
           #TARGET_CPU=x86
    

    GCC 

    For the GCC Makefile, add <mingw>\bin to your path, where <mingw> 
    is your MinGW root directory.).

    Change your current directory to src subfolder of the nethack 
    source tree.
        cd src

2.  Make sure all the NetHack files are in the appropriate directory
    structure.  You should have a main directory with subdirectories
    dat, doc, include, src, sys\share, sys\winnt, util, and binary (The
    "binary" directory was created by nhsetup.bat earlier if you
    followed the steps appropriately).

    For Console NetHack you need win\tty in addition to these; for
    Graphical NetHack you need win\win32 in addition to these.

    Other subdirectories may also be included in your distribution, but
    they are not necessary for building the TTY version for the Win32 
    console subsystem.  You can delete them to save space.

    Required Directories for a Win32 Console NetHack:

                            top
                             |
        ----------------------------------------------------/ /----- 
        |       |     |        |       |     |          |        |
       util    dat   doc    include   src   sys        win     binary
                                             |          |
                                          ------      ----- 
                                          |    |      |    
                                       share  winnt  tty  
 

    Required Directories for a Win32 Graphical NetHack:

                            top
                             |
        ----------------------------------------------------/ /----- 
        |       |     |        |       |     |          |        |
       util    dat   doc    include   src   sys        win     binary
                                             |          |
                                          ------      ----- 
                                          |    |          |
                                       share  winnt      win32 
 
    Check the file "Files" in your top level directory for an exact
    listing of what file is in which directory.  In order for the
    Makefiles to work, all the source files must be in the proper
    locations.

    If you downloaded or ftp'd the sources from a UNIX system, the lines
    will probably end in UNIX-style newlines, instead of the carriage
    return and line feed pairs used by Windows.  Some programs have
    trouble with them, so you may need to convert them. The compiler
    should not have any problems with them however.

3.  Now go to the include subdirectory to check a couple of the header
    files there.  Things *should* work as they are, but since you have
    probably set up your system in some sort of custom configuration it
    doesn't hurt to check out the following:

    First check config.h according to the comments to match your system
    and desired set of features.  Mostly you need to check section 4 and
    5.

    You may include all or as few of the special game features as you
    wish (they are located last in the file).

4.  Edit your Makefile if you wish, but it is not required unless
    you are altering the build options.

    If you are recompiling after patching your sources, or if you got
    your files from somewhere other than the official distribution,
    "touch makedefs.c" to ensure that certain files (onames.h and pm.h)
    are remade, lest potentially troublesome timestamps fool your make
    (or nmake) utility.

Compiling

5.  Now that everything is set up...

    For Visual Studio 2013 Express, as mentioned above, you should now be
    at the command prompt to carry out the build and your current 
    directory should be the src subdirectory in the NetHack source tree.

    In the src subdirectory, issue this command:
	        nmake install

    For GCC:
	Change your current directory to the NetHack src directory.
	Issue this command:
        	mingw32-make -f Makefile.gcc install

    If you get any errors along the way then something has not been set
    up correctly. The time it takes to compile depends on your
    particular machine of course, but you should be able to go for lunch
    and return to find everything finished.  The less memory, and slower
    your machine, the longer the lunch you may take. :-)
    
    In any case, it is likely that the command prompt window where you
    are doing the compiling will be occupied for a while.  If all goes
    well, you will get an NetHack executable.

Notes:

1.  To install an update of NetHack after changing something, change
    your current directory to src and issue the appropriate command for
    your compiler:

    For Microsoft compiler: 
        nmake

    For GCC:
        mingw32-make -f Makefile.gcc

    If you add, delete, or reorder monsters or objects, or you change
    the format of saved level files, delete any save and bones files.
    (Trying to use such files sometimes produces amusing confusions on
    the game's part, but usually crashes.)

    If you made changes to any of the level compiler software, you may
    have to delete dgn_flex.c, dgn_yacc.c, lev_flex.c, and lev_yacc.c
    from the util directory to ensure that they are remade.

2.  Depending on the build and compiler and tools used above, the 
    executable produced by the TTY build is either:
      - a 32-bit (x86), flat-address space, non-overlayed .exe file, 
        which should run on any recent Win32 environment.
    or
      - a 64-bit (x64) .exe file, 
        which should run on any 64-bit Windows O/S.

    To run NetHack, proceed to RUNNING NETHACK.

/-------------------------------------------------\
| BUILDING USING VISUAL STUDIO 2013 EXPRESS IDE   |
\-------------------------------------------------/

Only the native port built on the Windows API, or Graphical
NetHack, can be built using the Visual Studo 2013 Express IDE.

I. Dispelling the Myths:

    Compiling NetHack using the Visual C IDE is straightforward, as long
    as you have your compiler and tools correctly installed.

    It is again assumed that you already changed your directory to
    sys\winnt and executed:
	nhsetup
    as described at the top of this document. If you didn't, you must go
    back and do so before proceeding.

II. To compile your copy of NetHack for Windows on a Windows machine 
    using the Visual Studio 2013 Express IDE:

Setting Up

1.  It almost goes without saying that you should make sure that your
    tools are set up and running correctly. (For the Microsoft Visual
    Studio 2013 ExpressIDE it should correctly fire up when you choose 
    it:
        Start | All Programs | Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Express
    and select 
        Visual C++ 2013 Express

2.  Make sure all the NetHack files are in the appropriate directory
    structure.  You should have a main directory with subdirectories
    dat, doc, include, src, sys\share, sys\winnt, util, win\win32, and
    at this point you should also have a build directory and a binary
    directory (both created by nhsetup.bat executed from sys\winnt
    earlier.)

    Other subdirectories may also be included in your distribution, but
    they are not necessary for building the graphical version of NetHack
    (you can delete them to save space if you wish.)

    Required Directories for building Graphical NetHack with the Visual
    C IDE:

                            top
                             |
        -----------------------------------------/ /--------------- 
        |     |    |      |     |   |      |           |       |
       util  dat  doc  include src sys    win        build    binary
                                    |      |
                                  ------   -----
                                  |    |       |    
                               share  winnt  win32
 
    Those last two (build and binary) are created during the building
    process.  They are not disributed as part of the NetHack source 
    distribution.  nhsetup.bat creates the build directory and moves a
    few files into it, including the Visual C project files.  The
    "binary" directory will house everything you need to play the game
    after building is complete.

    Check the file "Files" in your top level directory for an exact
    listing of what file is in which directory.  In order for the build
    process to work, all the source files must be in the proper
    locations.  Remember that nhsetup.bat moves/copies many files around
    to their intended locations for building NetHack.

    If you downloaded or ftp'd the sources from a UNIX system, the lines
    will probably end in UNIX-style newlines, instead of the carriage
    return and line feed pairs used by Windows.  Visual C project files
    and workspace files (dsp and dsw files) in particular need to have
    their lines end in carriage-return-line-feed or they won't work
    properly.

3.  Ready your tool.
    Note: It's possible to build a graphical version using the Makefile,
    as explained above. However, the IDE build has full game
    functionality.

    Start the Visual Studio 2013 Express IDE:
        Start | All Programs | Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Express
    and select 
        Visual C++ 2013 Express

    In the Visual C++ 2013 Express IDE menus, choose:
        File | Open Project/Solution
     

4.  Set up for the build.

    In the Visual C dialog box, navigate to the top of
    your NetHack source directory.

    In there, highlight "nethack.sln" for Visual C++ 2013 Express Edition 
    and click on Open.

    Once the workspace or solution has been opened, you should see 
    the following list in the Visual C selection left pane:
      + dgncomp
      + dgnstuff
      + dlb_main
      + levcomp
      + levstuff
      + makedefs
      + nethackw
      + recover
      + tile2bmp
      + tilemap
      + uudecode

    On the Visual C++ 2013 Express IDE menus, NetHackW should be the startup
    project in bold, but if it isn't make it so by right-clicking and
    choosing "set as Startup Project."

    In Visual C 2013 Express IDE menus right-click on 
    "Solution NetHack (14 Projects)" and select "Configuration Manager."

    Set the "Active Solution Configuration" to either 
        Debug
    or
        Release
    and click the "Close" button.


    The Release build of NetHackW which does not contain all the 
    debugging information and is smaller, and runs slightly quicker.  
    The Debug build of NetHackW will spend time writing debug information 
    to the disk as the game is played. Unless you are debugging or 
    enhancing NetHack for Windows, you probably will want to choose the 
    Release build.

Building
    
5.  Start your build.

    On the Visual C++ Express IDE menus once again, choose:
        Debug | Build Solution
    or press <F7> to accomplish the same thing.

    That starts the build.  It is likely that the IDE message window 
    where you are doing the compiling will be occupied for a while.

6.  If all has gone well to this point, you should now have a NetHack
    executable called NetHackW.exe in the "binary" directory, along with
    all the support files that it needs.
 
 

/-----------------\
| RUNNING NETHACK |
\-----------------/

I. Checking the installation:
    Make sure all of the support files -- Guidebook.txt, license,
    Defaults.nh, NetHack.exe or NetHackW.exe, nhdat, and recover.exe --
    were copied to the game directory.  If not, move them there
    yourself.

    Edit Defaults.nh to reflect your particular setup and personal 
    preferences, by following the comments.  As with all releases since
    3.2.1, HACKDIR defaults to the same directory as that where the
    NetHack.exe or NetHackW.exe executable resides.  You only need to
    set HACKDIR in defaults.nh if, for some reason, you wish to override
    that (be careful).
  
II. Executing the game

1.  Running from the command prompt:

    If you add the directory containing the NetHack executable to your
    PATH, you can just type "nethack" or "nethack -umike" or "nethackw"
    or "nethackw -umike" to start it up.  Alternatively, you can
    explicitly invoke it with a command such as
    "c:\nethack\binary\nethack.exe" or "c:\nethack\binary\nethackw.exe"
    (specifying whatever drive and directory your NetHack executable
    resides in) each time.

2.  Running from a Windows shortcut.

    If you will be running it by launching it from a shortcut, just use
    the following information when setting up the shortcut.

        Description      :  NetHack 3.6.0 Console version
        Command Line     :  C:\NETHACK\BINARY\NETHACK.EXE

        Description      :  NetHack 3.6.0 Graphical Interface
         Command Line     :  C:\NETHACK\BINARY\NETHACKW.EXE

   (changing the directory to the appropriate one of course)

III. Play NetHack.  If it works, you're done!
