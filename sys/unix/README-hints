The sys/unix/hints subfolder contains Makefile content building blocks
for various platforms and purposes.

The sys/unix/hints/include subfolder contains Makefile content that
is included in the distributed Makefiles.


[.370 hints]


There are two .370 series hints files provided with NetHack:
    linux.370    for use on Linux
    macOS.370    for use on macOS

Those will also pull in content from sys/unix/hints/include/*.370,
that is shared between the linux.370 and macOS.370 hints files.


[.370 make build options]


Here are some options that can be specified on the make command
line to trigger specific build behavior. These are not mutually
exclusive and multiple build options can be specified in many
cases to include support for multiple features. Some of the options
require prerequisite packages to be available on your build machine.

make WANT_WIN_TTY=1           Include support for the TTY interface (default).
make NANT_WIN_CURSES=1        Include support for the curses interface.
make WANT_WIN_X11=1           Include support for the X11 interface.
make WANT_WIN_Qt=1            Include support for Qt interface, defaults to Qt5.
make WANT_WIN_QT5=1           Include support for Qt5 interface.
make WANT_WIN_QT6=1           Include support for Qt6 interface. Only one Qtx
                              option can be specified.
make WANT_WIN_ALL=1           Include support for TTY,curses,X11, and Qt.
make WANT_WINCHAIN=1          Include support for WINCHAIN.
make WANT_LIBNH=1             Include support for libnh NetHack library.

make WANT_DEFAULT=tty         Make tty the default interface if multiple window
                              interfaces were specified.
make WANT_DEFAULT=curses      Make curses the default interface if multiple window
                              interfaces were specified.
make WANT_DEFAULT=X11         Make X11 the default interface if multiple window
                              interfaces were specified.
make WANT_DEFAULT=Qt          Make Qt the default interface if multiple window
                              interfaces were specified.

make CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 package Cross-compile for an MSDOS target package.
make CROSS_TO_WASM=1          Cross-compile for a WASM target.
make CROSS_TO_MIPS=1          Cross-compile for a mips target.

make WANT_BUNDLE=1            For macOS.370 only, place the build results into 
                              a macOS bundle layout.
make WANT_MACSOUND=1          For macOS.370, include support for built-in macOS
                              sound libraries.
make WANT_SPEECH=1            If one of the sound libraries was included, also
                              include speech synthesis support (Recent macOS
                              build that also includes WANT_MACSOUND=1).

make WANT_ASAN=1              Include support for the address sanitizer in the
                              build.

make WANT_UBSAN=1             Include support for the undefined behaviour
                              sanitizer in the build.

make WANT_SHARE_INSTALL=1     Place the results of the install/update portion
                              of the build into a shared area on a multiuser
                              system.
                               
make WANT_SOURCE_INSTALL=1    Place the results of the install/update portion
                              of the build into a subfolder of the source
                              tree, rather than in a system-wide shared area.
make VIEWDEPRECATIONS=1       Turn off the suppression of -Wdeprecated and
                              -Wdeprecated-declarations warnings
