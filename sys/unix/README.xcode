This README provides the instructions for building the unofficial Mac
binaries using the Apple provided developer IDE named XCode.

Establish a developer team in XCode
===================================

Your first step should be to establish a developer team within XCode.
Launch XCode and open the preferences dialog (XCode Menu->Preferences).
Select the "Accounts" tab.  Add an account (usually this should just be
your apple ID account you used to setup the Mac).  After adding the account,
select the account and then add a team (usually this will be just a
personal team for Mac Development).

Obtain your developer team identifier
=====================================

Your DEVELOPMENT_TEAM can be found by opening Keychain Access
(found by Finder->Applications->Utilities).  Click on "My Certificates".
Look for your "Mac Developer" certificate.  Right click on
the certificate to open a dialog that shows certificate details.
Look for "Organizational Unit" among the details.  This ten digit value
is your development team identifier.

Create XCodeLocal.xcconfig file
===============================

Now you need to create the XCodeLocal.xcconfig file that will be used by
XCode to get your development team identifier.  Create the file in
sys/unix and add a single line such as:
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = XXXXXXXXXX

Where XXXXXXXXXX is replaced with your development team identifier.

Open the project and build
==========================

In XCode open the project file sys\unix\NetHack.xcodeproj, select
the product NetHack and build.  The build results are placed in
~nethackdir.
