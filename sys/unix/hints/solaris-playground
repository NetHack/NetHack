#-PRE
# This hints file provides a shared playground build for Solaris, specifically
# for Solaris 10 and 11, but should work just fine on older versions

# Nethack will install suid games, and will expect to read a users .nethackrc file from
# their home directory which may be a problem on secure systems with read restricted home
# directories,  not that you would problably run NetHack on such a system anyway.  :)

# Build using using included gcc and gmake, optional flex and bison come from csw for solaris 10 
# and included on Solaris 11
