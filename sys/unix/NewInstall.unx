                Instructions for installing NetHack 3.7
			using the new hints system
                =======================================

For the moment, we are maintaining two ways to configure NetHack.  The
traditional system, in which Makefiles and includes are edited, and the
new hints system which should be easier for most users to configure.

If you are using the traditional configuration system, see Install.unx.

1. Look in the sys/unix/hints directory for a file that matches your system.
   If there isn't one, build one from the other files; if you need more help
   see the traditional instructions (in Install.unx) for hints.  When you
   get it right please submit it to us.

2. Check the hints file for anything that may need to be changed for your
   installation.  Most of the time little or nothing will need to be changed.

3. Configure and build:
   "$Top" is the top level source directory (the one with README in it).

	cd $Top/sys/unix
	sh setup.sh hints/NAME_OF_HINTS_FILE
	cd ../..
	make fetch-Lua
	make all

   If the build fails, remove all the generated files before retrying the
   build with: cd $Top; make spotless

   The 'make fetch-Lua' step really only needs to be done one time unless 
   your sources get refreshed, or the lib folder and its contents get
   removed.

4. Install:
   Depending on your configuration, this step may or may not need to be done
   as root; check the hints file.
   NB: "make install" deletes nethackdir and recreates it from scratch - so
   if you want the record, logfile, or sysconf files, you must save and
   restore them manually.
	cd $Top
	make install

5. If it all worked, you're done.  If something went wrong, see Install.unx
   for information about the settings the hints file tried to automate.
