# NetHack 3.6 sysconf $NHDT-Date$ $NHDT-Branch$:$NHDT-Revision$
#
# Sample sysconf file.
# The sysconf file is only used if NetHack is compiled with SYSCF defined.
# It can be used to augment or override certain settings compiled into the
# program.
#
# This file can also be used to set local system defaults for run-time
# options, using the same syntax as an individual user's ./nethackrc file.

# Which users can use debug mode (aka wizard mode; accessed via '-D' command
# line flag or OPTIONS=playmode:debug in the runtime options config file).
# A value of * allows anyone to enter debugging mode.
WIZARDS=root games

# Which users can use explore mode (aka discover mode; accessed via '-X'
# command line flag or OPTIONS=playmode:explore in runtime options file or
# via '#exploremode' command during normal play).  Same syntax as WIZARDS.
EXPLORERS=*

# Users allowed to use the '!' (shell escape) and '^Z' (suspend process)
# commands to temporarily leave the game and enter a shell process.
# (To resume play, use the shell command 'exit' (for most shells) to
# return from '!' or the shell command 'fg' to return from '^Z'.
# For the typical multi-user system where players have access to a shell
# prompt when logged in and run the game from their own username, a value
# of 'SHELLERS=*' is appropriate.  However, some inexperienced players
# occasionally get stuck outside the game by accidentally typing '!' or
# '^Z' during play and not knowing how to go back.)
# Uses the same syntax as the WIZARDS and EXPLORERS options above.
#SHELLERS=

# If the user name is found in this list, prompt for username instead.
# Uses the same syntax as the WIZARDS option above.
# A public server should probably disable this.
GENERICUSERS=play player game games nethack nethacker

# Use the player name for matching WIZARDS, EXPLORERS and SHELLERS,
# instead of the user's login name.
#CHECK_PLNAME=1

# Limit the number of simultaneous games (see also nethack.sh).
# Valid values are 0-25.
# Commenting this out or setting the value to 0 constructs lock files
# with UID and playername, so each user may have one game at a time,
# but number of different players is not limited.
# Setting this to any other value constructs the lock files with
# letter and "lock" (eg. alock, block, ...)
MAXPLAYERS=10

# If not null, added to string "To get local support, " in the support
# information help.
#SUPPORT=call Izchak at extension 42.

# If not null, displayed at the end of a panic-save sequence.
#RECOVER=Run the recover program.

# Uncomment the next line to disable the SEDUCE option, causing succubi and
# incubi to use nymphs' charm behavior rather than their own seduce behavior.
#SEDUCE=0

# Uncomment to disable savefile UID checking.
#CHECK_SAVE_UID=0

# Record (high score) file options.
# CAUTION: changing these after people have started playing games can
#  lead to lost high scores!
# Maximum entries for one person.
#PERSMAX=10
# Maximum entries in the record file.
#ENTRYMAX=100
# Minimum points to get an entry.
#POINTSMIN=1
# Determine identity of "person" in the score file with name (0) or
# numeric (1) user id.
#PERS_IS_UID=1

# Maximum number of score file entries to use for random statue names
#MAX_STATUENAME_RANK=10

# Use "Live logging" for in-game progress (achievements, wishes, etc)
# Bitmask for kinds of things you want to log - sum the following values
# as desired.
# 0 - No live logging
# 1 - Traditional 3.4.3-nao style logging (wishes, lifesaves, invocation, planes)
# 2 - Achievements, as recorded in the achievement bitfield.
# 4 - Unique kills (Juiblex, Famine, Quest nemesis, etc)
# 8 - Significant religious events (sacrifice gifts, crowning)
# 16 - Not used (yet)
# 32 - Break conduct - can be spammy early-game
# 64 - Enter new level for the first time (excruciatingly verbose but good for testing)
# 128 - reserved for temporary debugging and/or tournament use
# Enabled at compile time by defining LIVELOGFILE in config.h
# LIVELOG=63

# Do not livelog breaking of conducts before this turncount
# Cuts down on spam
# LLC_TURNS=3000

# Show debugging information originating from these source files.
# Use '*' for all, or list source files separated by spaces.
# Only available if game has been compiled with DEBUG, and can be
# overridden via DEBUGFILES environment variable.
#DEBUGFILES=*

# Save end of game dump log to this file.
# Only available if NetHack was compiled with DUMPLOG
# Allows following placeholders:
#   %% literal '%'
#   %v version (eg. "3.6.1-0")
#   %u game UID
#   %t game start time, UNIX timestamp format
#   %T current time, UNIX timestamp format
#   %d game start time, YYYYMMDDhhmmss format
#   %D current time, YYYYMMDDhhmmss format
#   %n player name
#   %N first character of player name
#DUMPLOGFILE=/tmp/nethack.%n.%d.log

# Try to get more info in case of a program bug or crash.  Only used
# if the program is built with the PANICTRACE compile-time option enabled.
# By default PANICTRACE is enabled if BETA is defined, otherwise disabled.
# Using GDB can get more information and works on more systems but requires
# 'gdb' be available; using LIBC only works if NetHack is linked with a
# libc that supports the backtrace(3) API.  Both require certain compilation
# options.  See src/end.c and sys/unix/hints/* for more information.
GDBPATH=/usr/bin/gdb

# Values are priorities: 0 - do not use this method, 1 - low priority,
# 2 - high priority.  Non-zero priority methods are tried in order.
PANICTRACE_GDB=1
PANICTRACE_LIBC=2

# Ordinary run-time options can be set here to override the builtin-in
# default values.  Unlike the SYSCF values above, individual users can
# still choose their own option settings via NETHACKOPTIONS in their
# environment or via ~/.nethackrc run-time configuration file.
