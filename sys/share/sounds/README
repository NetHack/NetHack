README for the AIFF files:

These files are sound files for the instruments in NetHack.
There are 11 sounds, one for each distinct instrument.
The sounds are in 8-bit 22kHz AIFF format, which should be
readable by a broad range of platforms. Since the sounds
came from Rolands S-750 sample library (most of them) there
should be no copyright on them when we treat them like we
do here (as instruments) - indeed, the sample library I
got from Roland didn't even bear a (c) symbol.

Some of the sounds are very adequate (Drum of Earthquake,
Wooden Flute, Magic Harp) while some are less true to the
original name (how does a Frost Horn sound?) Actually, I
don't know what a Bugle is (Bugle horn?) so I took a trumpet
sound for that. Correct me if I'm wrong.

What does this have to do with the main code? Well, nothing
so far. There are some places that are #ifdef MAC and calls
mac_speaker; that function takes an object and a tune (in
capital letters A-G) and plays the tune with the given
instrument. When playing a specific tune, that tune is of
course used. For "improvise," I use middle "C."

Ideally, we should do something equal with sound that we
have with displays, so we can use one common set of calls
in the main code, and have ports do whatever seems appropriate
for the available hardware.

Any comment on the sounds or their use is welcome:
