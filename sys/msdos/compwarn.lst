This file contains a list of compiler warnings generated by Microsoft
C version 7.0, compiled with the /W4 switch, and any known reasons for
the warning.  You can safely ignore any warning your compile gives if
it appears on this list.

C4127 (4):  Conditional expression is constant
	    The While(1) statements used in the code cause this warning.
	    For the sake of making more easily readable code, this is the
	    preferred construct for NetHack.
C4131 (4):  function: uses old-style declarator
	    In order to make the code as portable as possible, all func-
	    tions in NetHack use the old-style declarator.
