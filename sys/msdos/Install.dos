Credit for a runnable full PC NetHack 3.7 goes to the PC Development team
of Paul Winner, Kevin Smolkowski, Michael Allison, Yitzhak Sapir, Bill Dyer,
Timo Hakulinen, Yamamoto Keizo, Mike Threepoint, Mike Stephenson,
Stephen White, Ken Washikita and Janet Walz.  The present port is based
on the previous effort of Pierre Martineau, Stephen Spackman, Steve Creps, Mike
Threepoint, Mike Stephenson, Norm Meluch and Don Kneller.

I.  Dispelling the Myths:

    Compiling NetHack is not as easy as it sounds, nor as hard as it looks,
    however it will behoove you to read this entire file through before
    beginning the task.


II. There once was a time when people built NetHack right on their DOS machine.
    The arcane recipe often involved flat cylinders known as "floppy disks",
    much gnashing of teeth, squeezing large things into small spaces, and
    required the sacrifice of copious amounts of time and coffee.

    These days, to compile your copy of NetHack on Linux or macOS machine you
    can use Andrew Wu's djgpp cross-compiler from:
        https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp
    downloaded from:
        https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp/releases/download/v3.0/ 
    a DOS-extender (for including in msdos packaging) from:
        http://sandmann.dotster.com/cwsdpmi/csdpmi7b.zip
    and Lua from:
        http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.4.6.tar.gz

    If you want the DOSVGA build, to support higher resolutions and Unicode
    symbols, you also need:
        pdcursesmod from:
            https://github.com/Bill-Gray/PDCursesMod.git
            (Name this lib/pdcurmod for the native build)
        Terminus fonts from:
            https://sourceforge.net/projects/terminus-font/files/terminus-font-4.49/terminus-font-4.49.1.tar.gz
            (Name this lib/terminus for the native build)
    If not, you also need:
        pdcurses from:
            https://github.com/wmcbrine/PDCurses.git

    - A shell script to download the above-mentioned djgpp cross-compiler and
      associated support pieces for either linux or macOS is available:
        sh sys/msdos/fetch-cross-compiler.sh

    That script won't install anything, it just does file fetches and stores
    them in subfolders of lib. The linux.370 and macOS.370 hints files are
    configured to find the cross-compiler there if you add
        CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1
    on your make command line.

    Note: Both the fetch-cross-compiler.sh script and and the msdos
    cross-compile and package procedures require unzip and zip to be available
    on your host build system.

    On your linux host:

        cd sys/unix ; sh setup.sh hints/linux.370 ; cd ../..
        make fetch-lua

    On your macOS host:

        cd sys/unix ; sh setup.sh hints/macOS.370 ; cd ../..
        make fetch-lua

    The MSDOS cross-compile can then be carried out by specifying
    CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 on the make command line:

        make CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 all
        make CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 package

    You can explicitly include tty and curses support if desired. The default
    you'll end up with is a tty-only cross-compile build:

        make WANT_WIN_TTY=1 WANT_WIN_CURSES=1 CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 all
        make WANT_WIN_TTY=1 WANT_WIN_CURSES=1 CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 package

    Add WANT_DOSVGA for a curses build that supports higher resolutions,
    external fonts and Unicode symbols:

        make WANT_WIN_TTY=1 WANT_WIN_CURSES=1 CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 WANT_DOSVGA=1 all
        make WANT_WIN_TTY=1 WANT_WIN_CURSES=1 CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 WANT_DOSVGA=1 package

    Result: The "make package" target will bundle all of the necessary
            components to run NetHack on msdos into a folder:
                targets/msdos/pkg
            and then it zips the contents of that folder into:
                targets/msdos/nh370dos.zip

    Also note that building the msdos targets using the make command
    above, does not preclude you from building local linux or macOS
    targets as well. Just drop the CROSS_TO_MSDOS=1 from the make
    command line. That's because the cross-compiler hints additions are
    enclosed inside ifdef sections and won't interfere with the
    non-cross-compile build in that case.

Appendix A - Additional Notes

1. In your game directory, review the settings in defaults.nh and adjust
    them according to your style of play.

2. Play NetHack.  If it works, you're done!
