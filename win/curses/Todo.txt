Below are some things I would like to see

NETHACK INTERFACE
=================

(These are the functions in cursmain.c called by the core NetHack code)

 * Implement curses_rip for optional fancier color tombstone, as well
 as one that will display correctly on smaller terminals.
 
 * I am confused as to how mark_synch, wait_synch, and delay_output
 should work.  Help, please?
 
 * Both PDCurses and Ncurses have mouse support, so the poskey function
 could probably be implemented easily enough.
 
 * raw_print is supposed to be able to work before the windowing system
 has been initialized, as well as after, so I am unsure if curses
 functions should be used here.  Maybe check to see if initscr() has
 been called, and use curses functions if so, and call initscr() from
 there is not?  Right now it is just a call to puts() with no support
 for bold text.


DISPLAY
=======

 * Consolidate refreshes of the display for smoother output.

 * Horizontal scrollbar to show position for displays < 80 columns.
 
 * Calls to getch() should probably be turned into wgetch() for the
 appropriate window.  This causes quirty cursor behavior under
 PDCurses, however.

 * Animation effects do not display properly - this could probably be
 fixed with a correct implementation of the delay_output function.

 * Support option to set forground and background colors for individual
 windows


MENUS
=====

(cursdial.c)

 * Menus need to be able to accept a count as input, e.g. to specifiy
 how many items to drop.
 
 * Currently the "preselected" flag for an individual menu item is
 ignored.  This should eventually be implemented.
 
 * Menus probably should never overlap with the message window, since
 the user sometmes needs to be able to see the messages while the menu
 is active, e.g. when identifying multiple items one at a time.
 
 * Perhaps allow for keyboard navigation of individual items, e.g.
 using the up and down arrows to move among the selectable items, and
 selecting individual items with the spacebar.  Perhaps the tab key
 could jump to the first selectable item after the next heading, and
 shift-tab could jump to the first item of the previous heading.


MESSAGE WINDOW
==============

(cursmesg.c)

 * Hitting Esc at the more prompt (which is '>>' for the curses
 interface) should suppress the display of any further messages for
 that turn like the tty interface does.


MAP WINDOW
==========

(curswins.c)

 * The map window would probably benefit from a total redesign.  Right
 now, it uses a pad instead of a regular curses window, which causes a
 number of special cases in the code to account for it, and a seperate
 window behind it just to draw the border.  It feels kludgy and
 annoying!


STATUS WINDOW
=============

(cursstat.c)

 * If the status window is on the right or left, then we have much more
 room to work with for each item horizontally.  Expand out some of the
 labels for clarity.  We can also list the current dungeon (e.g.
 Gnomish Mines) and perhaps show thermometer bars for hit points and
 magical power.
 
 * Conversely, if we have a narrower dislay, compress some of the
 labels to save space, and do not display some items that never or
 rarely change (e.g. name, level and title, and alignment).  Perhaps
 display changes to these fields in the message window if they do
 happen to change (e.g. converting to a new alignment).
 
 * Maybe add some configuration options for what colors are used and
 the like.

OTHER DIALOGS
=============

(cursdial.c)

 * curses_yn_function needs to accept a count if a '#' is present in
 choices string.
 
 * Extended commands should be enterable letter-by-letter via a '#'
 prompt if user does not have the extmenu command set to TRUE.
 
 * Character selection should allow for a random selection of any or
 all choices.


OTHER PLATFORMS
===============

 * PDCurses also work on DOS and OS/2.  Porting the curses interface to
 these platforms should not be too difficult.


MISC
====

 * Update documentation and in-game help to describe the newly-added
 options: cursesgraphics, term_rows, term_cols, and windowborders.

 * Recognize "Alt" key in a platform-independant way to allow its use
 to select extended commands.  Currently this works for PDCurses.  For
 Ncurses, the Alt key works in an xterm or rxvt if the -meta8 flag is
 passed, but I'd like to see a general way of detecting it.
 
 * PDCurses has a function named "addrawch" to output the visual
 representation of a control character to the screen without having the
 control character affect the display otherwise.  I would like to find
 a way to accomplish the same thing via Ncurses to e.g. be able to use
 a font like nh10 with the correct symbol mappings in an xterm or the
 like.
