Window ports can optionally make use of the tiles (pictures for NetHack
symbols) found in this directory.  They are distributed in a text format
with routines to help in converting them to a system's preferred format
and using them there.  The original tiles were provided by Warwick Allison.

The tile distribution format for monsters.txt, objects.txt, and other.txt
starts with a palette header like:

A = (0, 0, 0)
...
P = (254, 254, 254)

and then each tile has an entry like:

# tile 292 (comment identifying tile)
{
  AAAAGHPAAAAACDAA
  AAAFGDEMLOCNAAAA
...
}

Each port can convert these .txt files to whatever format it wants the
game executable to use, probably providing only one merged output file.
See the tilemap.c discussion at the bottom for more hints on adding tiles.


Shared code provided for conversion utilities:

tile.h contains shared declarations.

tiletext.c defines the external variables from tile.h and supplies
the external routines for reading and writing the defined text format.

Each conversion utility is expected to use tiletext.c and provide code of
its own for reading and/or writing another format.  The important global
variables implement a colormap shared between tiletext.c and the other
half of utilities.  As an example of conversion utilities, we provide
txt2ppm (tiletext.c + ppmwrite.c) and gif2txt (tiletext.c + gifread.c).
(Sorry, we're not paying Unisys patent royalties for the right to provide
you with a gifwrite.c, which would necessarily use the LZW compression
algorithm they claim.)

The text I/O routines are:

boolean fopen_text_file(const char *filename, const char *type);
	select file for subsequent tile I/O
	"type" a la fopen
	returns FALSE if file not opened, otherwise reads/writes header
	(including colormap) and sets up to decode/encode tiles
int fclose_text_file();
	close file
boolean read_text_tile(pixel[TILE_Y][TILE_X]);
	returns FALSE if no next tile in current file
	otherwise TRUE and insert the tile in the provided array
boolean write_text_tile(pixel[TILE_Y][TILE_X]);
	writes tile

There are some additional shared routines provided for writers:

void set_grayscale(boolean g);
	do grayscale color substitutions when reading the tile text file
void init_colormap();
	initialize the output colormap from the input one
	must be called before opening output file as colormap is part of header
void merge_colormap();
	merge the current input colormap into the output one

Due to the amount of state being kept, only one text or gif file can be
open at a time.  If you are combining multiple files into one other-format
file with a single common colormap, you may need to open each source file
and merge their colormaps into a common colormap before processing any tiles.

Although there are expected to be only 16 colors in the distribution tiles,
conversion programs should be prepared to accept up to MAXCOLORMAPSIZE
colors and map them to a smaller number if their port requires it.


Expected sequence for editing tiles:
	edit foo.txt

	-or-

	run txt2ppm foo.txt foo.ppm
	convert ppm to gif, either via ppmtogif from pbmplus/netpbm or
		stripping the first 15 bytes of foo.ppm (containing the
		size of the image) and feeding the rest to any raw-24bit-
		image-reading program
	edit tiles with gif-editing program
	run gif2txt foo.gif foo.txt


When converted to ppm, monsters.ppm, objects.ppm, and other.ppm are:
	each a single ppm format (rgb triples with header)
	20 tiles across, however many down (need "blank" tile to fill in
		extras on last row -- currently alternating pixels in
		first and second colors)
	allows looking at tiles en masse for comparison or whatever

The gif reading routines accept further variations so long as the gif is
n*TILE_X pixels across.

The gif I/O routines are:

boolean fopen_gif_file(const char *filename, const char *type);
	select file for subsequent tile I/O
	"type" a la fopen
	returns FALSE if file not opened, otherwise reads gif header
	(including colormap) and sets up to decode tiles
int fclose_gif_file();
	tear down decode mechanism
	close file
boolean read_gif_tile(pixel[TILE_Y][TILE_X]);
	returns FALSE if no next tile in current file (including when any
	remaining tiles are "blank"),
	otherwise TRUE and insert the tile in the provided array


Array provided by shared code for NetHack use, by compiling and running
tilemap.c to form tile.c:

glyph_map glyphmap[MAXGLYPH];
	maps glyph number to tile number, ( and later to ttychar, symidx,
        glyphflags) for display purposes, assuming (non-blank) tiles are
        numbered sequentially through monsters/objects/other

tilemap.c (shudder) accounts for things disappearing due to compilation
options -- there should be a tile for everything appearing under any
supported option, but under some options some tiles won't be referenced.
Therefore, tilemap.c has the knowledge to provide the comments for gif2txt
and is compiled with GIF2TXT to link in there, along with the various
strings for things that are compiled in (monst.o etc.).

If you add monsters/objects/other things to NetHack and need to add tiles
to go with them, just add an entry in the right place in the appropriate
.txt file, and one to tilemap.c if the new item is conditionally compiled.
While the "comment identifying tile" in the .txt file must be correct,
the number of the tile need not be, and can just be a duplicate of the
tile on either side (or any other integer, for that matter).  In an
official release, the tiles in a .txt file will be numbered consecutively
so that you may cross-reference with a graphics format, but the conversion
code does not care about the numbering.  (In fact, running txt2ppm, ppmtogif,
and gif2txt gives you a consecutively numbered version of the .txt file.)
