The MPW compilers are now supported again.

Support for 68k has been discontinued due to a lack of a debugging
system for 68k binaries.

Note that the tiled MacOS X port uses the Qt windowport and the UNIX
build system, not this windowport code.

NetHack 3.3.0 was built with Metrowerk's Pro 4 compiler on a PPC
system.  We are still compiling with 68K alignment because we know
it works.  No one has checked lately if the PPC alignment bug
still exists.

NetHack 3.2.1 was built with Metrowerk's DR8 compiler on a PPC system.
The official 68K and PPC versions were compiled with 68K Alignment
to share files.  The 3.2.0 versions were compiled with PPC alignment,
but it was discovered that the Metrowerks 68K compiler has a bug with
PPC alignment and structures that can be aligned to a single byte.  This
bug _may_ be fixed in DR10, it is not fixed in DR9.  Why bother with PPC
alignment at all?  Because the space saving from 68K alignment is small
and the PowerPC version will run better.  The 68K version was compiled
with 4 byte ints using the far model.
 
Only the Metrowerks compiler has been used to compile the code in a
long time.  It is _very_ likely that the other compilers, Think C and
MPW C, will no longer be able to compile NetHack out of the box.  They
and their files have been moved to the "old" directory until such time
that someone can compile with them.
