This document describes the installation of NetHack with a Qt interface
on UNIX/X11 or Mac OS X. This code should also work with Qt/Windows, but
support for that is not currently official.

You can download Qt from http://www.trolltech.com.
You need Qt 2.0 or later to use this code.

To use this code on UNIX (not Mac OS X):

   1. follow the directions for the UNIX installation (in ../../sys/unix)
      to create the Makefiles.

   2. ../../include/config.h

        define QT_GRAPHICS (search for it).  You can comment out
        TTY_GRAPHICS if you want to, or leave it in to support both
        interfaces (in which case be sure you have the right curses
        libraries etc. required for that interface).

   3. ../../src/Makefile

	ensure your QTDIR environment variable was set correctly when
	you installed Qt - $QTDIR/include/qwidget.h should exist, for
	example.

	ensure CXX and LINK are set to the compiler and linker you need
	for compiling and linking C++ software (e.g., set both to g++).

        add $(WINQTSRC), $(WINQTOBJ), and $(WINQTLIB) to WINSRC, WINOBJ,
        and WINLIB respectively, and compile.  This will give you an
        executable supporting both Qt and tty windowing.

   4. ../../Makefile (the top-level makefile)

        Just change the VARDATND setting to contain the files
	"x11tiles", "rip.xpm", and "nhsplash.xpm":

            VARDATND = x11tiles rip.xpm nhsplash.xpm

   5. Follow all the instructions in ../../sys/unix/Install.unx for
      the remainder of the installation process.

   6. Consider adding the lines below to your .nethackrc, as they are
      likely to give the best interface for this window port:

        OPTIONS=name:player,number_pad,menustyle:partial,!time,showexp
        OPTIONS=hilite_pet,toptenwin,msghistory:200,windowtype:Qt

If you are using KDE, you may want to also try the KDE version. It just
uses the KDE menubar and follows other KDE conventions - there is no
extra functionality. To do so:

   1. Ensure that you have KDE 2.x libraries on your system
        (in 1999 KDE 1.x was the norm)

   2. ../../src/Makefile

      Add $(KDECXXFLAGS) to the CXXFLAGS definition, $(KDELFLAGS) to
      the LFLAGS definition and $(WINKDELIB) to WINLIB.

   3. Some additional files here - knh-mini.xpm, knh.xpm, and
      knethack.lnk are useful if you want to install "knethack" in
      the KDE games directory.  

If you are using Qtopia, you can compile NetHack for that environment
with the following additional steps:

   1. First be sure that you can build a simple Qtopia application,
      such as the examples that ship with Qtopia. Do not attempt
      something as challenging to compile as NetHack before you can
      already build a Qtopia application for your target device.

   2. If you are cross-compiling (eg. targetting an ARM-based handheld),
      be sure to follow the steps for cross-compiling in the Makefile.src
      and Makefile.utl files.

   3. To CXXFLAGS in Makefile.src, add:
      -DQWS -I$(QPEDIR)/include -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions

   4. Rather than -lqt in WINQTLIB, have:
      -L$(QPEDIR)/lib -lqpe -lqte

   5. After building, use the "mkipks" program that ships with Qtopia
      to package the result into an ipk file.

To use this code on Mac OS X:

   1. follow the directions for the UNIX installation (in ../../sys/unix)
      to create the Makefiles.

   2. quite a number of changes are required to the Makefiles. They are
        slowly being made 'official', but for now they are all in the patch
	nethack-macosx-qt.patch:

	    cd ../..
	    patch -p0 < win/Qt/nethack-macosx-qt.patch

   3. Follow all the instructions in ../../sys/unix/Install.unx for
      the remainder of the installation process (basically run "make install").

   4. Consider adding the lines below to a file called "NetHack Defaults",
      in your "Library/Preferences" folder, as they are likely to give
      the best interface for this window port:

        OPTIONS=name:player,number_pad,menustyle:partial,!time,showexp
        OPTIONS=hilite_pet,toptenwin,msghistory:200,windowtype:Qt
