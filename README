                NetHack 3.6.2 -- General information

NetHack 3.6 is an enhancement to the dungeon exploration game NetHack,
which is a distant descendent of Rogue and Hack, and a direct descendent of
NetHack 3.4 as there was no NetHack 3.5 release.

NetHack 3.6.2 contains a collection of more than 220 bug fixes to NetHack 3.6.1.
The file doc/fixes36.2 in the source distribution has a full list of them. The
text in there was written for the development team's own use and is provided 
"as is", so please do not ask us to further explain the entries in that file. 
Some entries might be considered "spoilers", particularly in the "new features" 
section.

Below you will find some other general notes that were not considered
spoilers:
* Performance optimizations with tty including the ability to do per field 
  updating
* sys/winnt/nttty performance improvements mainly through the introduction
  of a back buffer approach
* a couple of windows crash bug fixes

Please read items (1), (2) and (3) BEFORE doing anything with your new code.

1.  Unpack the code in a dedicated new directory.  We will refer to that
    directory as the 'Top' directory.  It makes no difference what you
    call it.

2.  Having unpacked, you should have a file called 'Files' in your Top
    directory.  

    This file contains the list of all the files you now SHOULD
    have in each directory.  Please check the files in each directory
    against this list to make sure that you have a complete set.

    This file also contains a list of what files are created during 
    the build process.

    The names of the directories listed should not be changed unless you
    are ready to go through the makefiles and the makedefs program and change
    all the directory references in them.

3.  Before you do anything else, please read carefully the file called
    "license" in the 'dat' subdirectory.  It is expected that you comply
    with the terms of that license, and we are very serious about it.

4.  If everything is in order, you can now turn to trying to get the program
    to compile and run on your particular system.  It is worth mentioning
    that the default configuration is SysV/Sun/Solaris2.x (simply because
    the code was housed on such a system).

    The files sys/*/Install.* were written to guide you in configuring the
    program for your operating system.  The files win/*/Install.* are
    available, where necessary, to help you in configuring the program
    for particular windowing environments.  Reading them, and the man pages,
    should answer most of your questions.

    At the time of this release, NetHack 3.6 has been tested to run/compile
    on:

        Intel Pentium or better (or clone) running Linux, BSDI, or 
                Windows (7 through 10)
        Intel 80386 or greater (or clone) boxes running Linux, or BSDI
	Mac OS X 10.11 (follow the instructions in sys/unix, not sys/mac)
	OpenVMS (aka VMS) V8.4 on Alpha and on Integrity/Itanium/IA64

    Instructions have been provided by way of community contribution on:
        msdos protected mode using djgpp

        H/PC Pro devices running Windows CE 2.11 and higher
        Palm Size PC 1.1 devices running Windows CE 2.11

    Unless otherwise mentioned, the compiler used was the OS-vendor's
    C compiler.

If you have problems building the game, or you find bugs in it, we recommend 
filing a bug report from our "Contact Us" web page at:
    https://www.nethack.org/common/contact.html or
    http://www.nethack.org/common/contact.html
Please include the version information from #version or the command line
option --version in the appropriate field.

A public repository of the latest NetHack code that we've made
available can be obtained via git here:
    https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack
      or
    https://sourceforge.net/p/nethack/NetHack/

When sending correspondence, please observe the following:
o Please be sure to include your machine type, OS, and patchlevel.
o Please avoid sending us binary files (e.g. save files or bones files). 
  If you have found a bug and think that your save file would aid in solving
  the problem, send us a description in words of the problem, your machine 
  type, your operating system, and the version of NetHack.  Tell us that you 
  have a save file, but do not actually send it.
  You may then be contacted by a member of the development team with the 
  address of a specific person to send the save file to.
o Though we make an effort to reply to each bug report, it may take some
  time before you receive feedback.  This is especially true during the
  period immediately after a new release, when we get the most bug reports.
o We don't give hints for playing the game.
o Don't bother to ask when the next version will be out or you can expect
  to receive a stock answer.

If you want to submit a patch for the NetHack source code via email directly, 
you can direct it to this address:
    nethack-bugs (at) nethack.org

If a feature is not accepted you are free, of course, to post the patches 
to the net yourself and let the marketplace decide their worth.

All of this amounts to the following:  If you decide to apply a free-lanced
patch to your 3.6 code, you are welcome to do so, of course, but we won't
be able to provide support or receive bug reports for it.  

In our own patches, we will assume that your code is synchronized with ours.

                  -- Good luck, and happy Hacking --
